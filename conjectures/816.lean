# Erdős Problem #816

Let $G$ be a graph with $2n+1$ vertices and $n^2+n+1$ edges. Must $G$ contain two
vertices of the same degree which are joined by a path of length $3$?

A problem of Erdős and Hajnal. The example of $K_{n,n+1}$ shows that this fails
if we only have $n^2+n$ edges.

This was proved by Chen and Ma [ChMa25], who showed the stronger statement that,
provided $n \geq 600$, all graphs with $2n+1$ vertices and at least $n^2+n$ edges
contain two vertices of the same degree joined by a path of length $3$, except
$K_{n,n+1}$.

**Erdős Problem #816** (proved by Chen–Ma [ChMa25]):

For every $n$, every graph on $2n+1$ vertices with $n^2+n+1$ edges contains
two vertices of the same degree joined by a path of length $3$.

theorem erdos_816 :
    ∀ n : ℕ, ∀ G : SimpleGraph (Fin (2 * n + 1)),
      G.edgeSet.ncard = n ^ 2 + n + 1 →
        ∃ v w : Fin (2 * n + 1), v ≠ w ∧
          (G.neighborSet v).ncard = (G.neighborSet w).ncard ∧
          ∃ p : G.Walk v w, p.IsPath ∧ p.length = 3 :=
