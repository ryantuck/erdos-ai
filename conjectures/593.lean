# Erdős Problem #593

Characterize those finite 3-uniform hypergraphs which appear in every
3-uniform hypergraph of chromatic number > ℵ₀.

Similar problems were investigated by Erdős, Galvin, and Hajnal [EGH75].
Erdős claims that for graphs the problem is completely solved: a graph of
chromatic number ≥ ℵ₁ must contain all finite bipartite graphs but need not
contain any fixed odd cycle.

We define a finite 3-uniform hypergraph F to be *obligatory* if it appears
in every 3-uniform hypergraph of uncountable chromatic number. By analogy
with the graph case, we conjecture that the obligatory finite 3-uniform
hypergraphs are exactly the 2-colorable ones.

Erdős Problem #593 [Er95d]:

A finite 3-uniform hypergraph appears in every 3-uniform hypergraph of
uncountable chromatic number if and only if it is 2-colorable.

This is conjectured by analogy with the known graph result: a graph of
chromatic number ≥ ℵ₁ must contain all finite bipartite graphs but need not
contain any fixed odd cycle [EGH75].
