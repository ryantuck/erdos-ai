Erdős Problem #833:
Does there exist an absolute constant c > 0 such that, for all r ≥ 2,
in any r-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number 3 there is a vertex
contained in at least (1+c)^r many edges?

This was proved by Erdős and Lovász [ErLo75], who showed in particular
that there is a vertex contained in at least 2^{r-1}/(4r) many edges.
