`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

-/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ SomeProperty := by\n  sorry\n```\n\nNote that if the statement of the theorem depends on some variables, then the quantification should\nhappen *after* the `answer(sorry)`, i.e.\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n, P n := by\n  sorry\n```\nrather than\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name (n) : answer(sorry) ↔ P n := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n\nWhen the problem is solved:\n- Replace `answer(sorry)` with `answer(True)` or `answer(False)` as appropriate\n- Update the category to `research solved` or `research formally solved ...`\n\n**Note:** Providing a term inside `answer()` does NOT automatically mean the problem is mathematically solved - trivial or tautological answers don't count as solutions.\n\n### File Organization\n\n1. **One problem per file** (with flexibility for closely related variants)\n2. **Copyright header required** (see template in README.md, use year 2026)\n3. **Module docstring** with references:\n   ```lean\n   /-!\n   # Problem Name\n\n   *Reference:* [Title](URL)\n\n   Brief description if needed.\n   -/\n   ```\n4. **Import structure**:\n   - Problem files: Import `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n   - ForMathlib files: Import only necessary Mathlib modules\n5. If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied\n   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cb370d76-cacc-4329-ad62-72a407ac75bf"}

Let me apply the style guide to problem 77.\n\nLet me analyze the source file `conjectures/77.lean` and transform it:\n\n1. **Copyright header**: Need to add the 2026 copyright header\n2. **Import**: Replace all imports with `import FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n3. **Module docstring**: Reformat with `*Reference:*` link. The source has tags and citations - move references to module docstring.\n4. **open/open scoped**: Keep `open Filter Topology` but adjust format\n\n\n5. **Namespace**: Wrap in `namespace Erdos77 ... end Erdos77`\n6. **Category and AMS**: The main theorem asks whether the limit of R(k)^{1/k} exists and what its value is. Since the existence of this limit is itself an open problem, I should use `answer()` with category `research open` and AMS code `5` for combinatorics and Ramsey theory. So the main statement as written is: there exists L such that R(k)^{1/k} → L. This is essentially asserting the limit exists. The problem asks to find the value of lim_{k→∞} R(k)^{1/k}, which implicitly asks whether the limit exists—a yes/no question that should use `answer()`. Since the limit's existence is still open, I'll use `answer(sorry)`. This is about Ramsey theory in combinatorics. Now I need to rename `erdos_problem_77` to `erdos_77`, change bare `sorry` to `by sorry`, convert docstring math to LaTeX, mark `diagonalRamseyNumber` as `noncomputable` individually, and adjust the `open` statements to use `open Filter` and `open scoped Topology Real` separately based on what the theorem actually needs. Looking at the style guide more carefully, the distinction is whether this is asking for existence (yes/no) versus asking for the actual value. The docstring wants the specific limit value, but formalizing it as just \"∃ L\" is really just confirming existence rather than computing the value itself. The guide suggests avoiding `answer()` for existence results that are already stated as such, so I should stick with the plain assertion form without `answer()`. the true direction of a conjecture rather than as a question).\n\nThis is an existence statement. And the original problem is more about finding the value than asking if it exists. \n\nActually, the problem states:\n- \"find the value of lim_{k → ∞} R(k)^{1/k}\"\n- \"Erdős offered $100 for a proof that this limit exists\"\n\nThe formalization captures the existence part. It is formulated as a yes/no question (does the limit exist?). So `answer()` seems appropriate.\n\nLet me use `answer(sorry)` since it's an open question of whether the limit exists.\n\nNow I need to add proper LaTeX formatting to the docstrings. For the definition, I'll format the Ramsey number notation and the clique description with math mode. The theorem docstring needs the limit expression in LaTeX, and the module docstring should also use proper mathematical notation for the limit expression.\n\nI'm converting the mathematical expressions in the docstrings to proper LaTeX format for clarity and consistency with the reference files.\n\nNow I need to verify the file structure and namespace conventions by checking the existing examples, then determine which citations from the source material should be included in the Lean file based on the style guide requirements. I need to decide whether `answer()` is the right form here. The theorem states that a limit exists, which is fundamentally a yes/no question—does this limit exist?—so using `answer(sorry)` seems fitting since the existence is what we're trying to establish. Looking at the original problem statement more carefully, Erdős was explicitly asking a question—he offered money for a proof that the limit exists, which frames it as an open question rather than a stated conjecture. So I should use the `answer()` form to capture that yes/no nature. Now I'm ready to write out the formalization with that structure in place. I'm looking at the mathematical definition of the diagonal Ramsey number and what we're trying to find—the limit of its k-th root as k approaches infinity. The thinking then covers what's known about this limit: Erdős established bounds showing it's between √2 and 4, with recent breakthroughs by Campos et al. and Gupta et al. pushing the upper bound down to around 3.7992.\n\nErdős even offered prize money—$100 for proving the limit exists and $250 for determining its actual value. Now I'm seeing references to the key papers in this area and what appears to be the start of a formal mathematical definition in a proof assistant.\n\nDefining the Ramsey number formally... I'm reconsidering whether `answer()` is the right wrapper here—the style guide says not to use it for direct positive assertions like existence results, and this theorem is stating that the limit exists as an equivalence. Let me reformulate this without `answer()` since we're asserting the convergence directly rather than asking whether something is true. I need to make sure the citations are properly organized—[CGMS23] and [Er61] should be referenced in the module docstring if they're cited in the theorems. I'll keep things straightforward and only include what's actually in the source material without inventing missing details. Also, I should replace the `noncomputable section` block with individual `noncomputable` annotations on the relevant definitions like

The limit's existence is itself open (Erdős believed it exists but it hasn't been proved). The problem asks to \"determine the value\" which presupposes existence.\n\nNow let me also check: should I use `answer()` here? The problem asks to \"determine the value of the limit\" - this is asking for a specific value, not just yes/no. But the formalization only captures existence of the limit. Given that, and Erdős's phrasing, this is more of a question \"does the limit exist and what is its value?\"\n\nSince the formalization captures the existence question, and the existence is open, using `answer(sorry)` with the ↔ form seems appropriate.\n \nActually, looking at the Lean formalization more carefully - it's asserting the existence of a limit L. The style guide says not to use `answer()` for direct positive assertions like existence results, so I should just leave this as `sorry` without the `answer()` wrapper.\n\nBut wait, the guide also says to prefer `answer()` for yes/no questions like \"Does the limit exist?\" - and that's technically what this is asking. The real tension here is that the full problem isn't just about existence; it's asking to determine the actual value of the limit. The existence is almost assumed as background, and the hard part is finding what that limit equals.\n\nGiven that the formalization only captures the existence piece as a direct assertion rather than framing it as an open question, I'll skip `answer()` and just state it as a positive claim.
