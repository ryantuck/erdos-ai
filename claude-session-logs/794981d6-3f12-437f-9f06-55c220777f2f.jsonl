-/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ SomeProperty := by\n  sorry\n```\n\nNote that if the statement of the theorem depends on some variables, then the quantification should\nhappen *after* the `answer(sorry)`, i.e.\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n, P n := by\n  sorry\n```\nrather than\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name (n) : answer(sorry) ↔ P n := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n\nWhen the problem is solved:\n- Replace `answer(sorry)` with `answer(True)` or `answer(False)` as appropriate\n- Update the category to `research solved` or `research formally solved ...`\n\n**Note:** Providing a term inside `answer()` does NOT automatically mean the problem is mathematically solved - trivial or tautological answers don't count as solutions.\n\n### File Organization\n\n1. **One problem per file** (with flexibility for closely related variants)\n2. **Copyright header required** (see template in README.md, use year 2026)\n3. **Module docstring** with references:\n   ```lean\n   /-!\n   # Problem Name\n\n   *Reference:* [Title](URL)\n\n   Brief description if needed.\n   -/\n   ```\n4. **Import structure**:\n   - Problem files: Import `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n   - ForMathlib files: Import only necessary Mathlib modules\n5. If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied\n   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ac76f639-3396-4fd7-ab15-3eab01b6e1bf"}

Let me analyze what I need to do:\n\n1. `conjectures/34.lean` exists - it's the source file\n2. `deepmind/34.lean` does NOT exist - so I can proceed\n3. The style guide says to apply the DeepMind/FormalConjectures conventions\n\nLet me analyze the source file:\n- It has a `noncomputable def consecutiveSums` \n- It has a theorem `erdos_problem_34` that states the original (false) conjecture\n\nLooking at the docstring more carefully:\n> This was disproved by Hegyvári (1986) and shown to be extremely false by Konieczny (2015), who proved that a random permutation has ∼(1+e⁻²)/4 · n² distinct consecutive sums.\n \nThe theorem statement is claiming that for any small ε > 0, there exists some threshold N where all permutations of n elements (for n ≥ N) have at most ε·n² consecutive sums—which is exactly the false conjecture that was disproven. The conjecture is phrased as a yes/no question—\"Is S(π) = o(n²) for all permutations?\"—so even though it's been disproved, I should use the `answer()` form with `False` rather than treating it as a direct assertion. Finishing the theorem statement with the full quantification over permutations and consecutive sums, then marking this as a solved research problem that was disproven by Hegyvári in 1986. For the AMS classification, combinatorics is the primary fit here since it deals with permutation properties and counting consecutive sums.\n\nNow I'm setting up the Lean file structure with the appropriate imports and namespace, then defining the helper function for computing consecutive sums of a permutation before stating the main theorem. I'm setting up the Lean file structure with the proper copyright header and imports, then adding the module documentation that references the Erdős problem and includes the citation keys for Hegyvári and Konieczny's work on this disproved conjecture.\n\nNow I'm defining the core function that computes the set of all distinct consecutive sums for a given permutation of Fin n, where each consecutive sum represents the total of elements in a contiguous range of the permuted sequence. I'm seeing that this conjecture was actually disproven—Hegyvári and later Konieczny showed that random permutations achieve roughly (1+e^(-2))/4 · n² distinct consecutive sums, which is quadratic in n. Now I'm formalizing this by stating the answer is False and setting up the theorem to capture what it means for the conjecture to fail.\n\nFinishing the proof

The `deepmind/` directory exists. Now let me write `deepmind/34.lean`.\n\nLet me think about the structure again:\n\n**Problem 34**: The conjecture is that for all permutations π, the number of distinct consecutive sums S(π) = o(n²). This was DISPROVED by Hegyvári (1986). So:\n\n- Category: `research solved` (it's been solved - it's false)\n- Answer: `answer(False)` since the yes/no question has a known answer (no, it's not true that S(π) = o(n²) for all π)\n\n\n- AMS: `5` (combinatorics)\n\nNow I need to formalize the false conjecture properly. The statement asserts that for any small ε, there exists an N such that for all n ≥ N and all permutations σ, the cardinality of consecutive sums is bounded by ε·n². To represent this as a yes/no question with `answer(False)`, I'm setting up the logical structure where the conjecture itself is the proposition being negated.\n\nI should also verify whether the imports from `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports` cover everything needed, or if I need to explicitly open additional namespaces like `Finset`, `BigOperators`, and `Equiv`. Looking at the reference implementation, it seems some opens are still necessary even with the unified import, so I'll include them.\n\nNow I'm working on the docstring for `consecutiveSums`, which should explain that for a permutation σ of Fin n, we're collecting all distinct sums formed by consecutive elements, where each element is shifted by 1 to represent the values 1 through n. The conjecture that all permutations have $o(n^2)$ distinct consecutive sums was actually disproven—Hegyvári refuted it, and Konieczny later showed how dramatically false it is, proving that random permutations achieve roughly $\\frac{1+e^{-2}}{4} \\cdot n^2$ distinct consecutive sums.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2805,"cache_read_input_tokens":36777,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2805,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYVEkcijQLcjspCf6rBoH","type":"assistant","uuid":"e9888f58-64d2-4e29-b95c-ebad210a2ea6","timestamp":"2026-02-25T18:11:24.993Z"}
