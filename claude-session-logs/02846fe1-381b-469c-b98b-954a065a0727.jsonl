`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"32c3e4e9-1078-4815-a61a-01ed8e3ab834"}

Now let me apply all the transformations specified in the style guide.\n\nLet me analyze problem 110:\n\n**Source**: `conjectures/110.lean`\n\n**Step 2 - Category and answer() usage:**\n\n2a. Category: The conjecture is FALSE (disproved by Lambie-Hanson). So it's `research solved`. The docstring says \"Lambie-Hanson [La20] constructed a ZFC counterexample, so the conjecture is FALSE.\"\n\nSince it's a yes/no question (\"Is there some function F...?\"), I should use `answer()`. The answer is known to be **no** (FALSE), so `answer(False)`.\n \n2b. AMS: This problem combines graph theory with set-theoretic foundations—the chromatic number question involves combinatorics (AMS 5) while the ZFC consistency aspects and aleph numbers point to mathematical logic and foundations (AMS 3). I'll use `AMS 5 3`.\n\n2c. answer(): The question asks whether such a function F exists, and the answer is no—so I need `answer(False)`. But I'm realizing the theorem statement asserts existence with `∃ F : ℕ → ℕ`, which means if the answer is False, the theorem itself should be negated or reformulated to match that answer.\n\n**Step 3 - Transformations:**\n\n3.1 Copyright header: 2026\n\n3.2 Import: `import FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n\n3.3 Module docstring with the problem reference and citations...\n\n3.4 open statements: Keep `open SimpleGraph Cardinal`\n\n3.5 Namespace: `namespace Erdos110 ... end Erdos110`\n\n3.6 Category: `@[category research solved, AMS 5 3]` for the theorem\n\n3.7 Theorem name: `erdos_110` (from `erdos_problem_110`)\n\n3.8 sorry style: Change `sorry` to `by sorry`\n\n3.9 Converting the docstring math notation to LaTeX format...\n\n3.10 The definition `HasChromaticNumberAleph1` stays as is since it's a `Prop` and doesn't need `noncomputable`. No category tags needed for definitions.\n\n3.11 Moving citation keys to the module docstring and converting remaining math notation to LaTeX throughout.\n\nWriting the output file...\n\nActually, I need to check the style guide for yes/no questions. The theorem is asking \"Is there some function F...?\" which is definitely a yes/no question, so I should use the `answer()` form. The answer is False since no such function exists. Let me restructure the theorem to use `answer(False)` with the existential statement following it.\n\nNow I'm double-checking the AMS classification codes. Graph coloring and chromatic numbers fall under combinatorics (5), and the infinite cardinals involved suggest set theory (03). Looking at the reference files and style guide, the codes should be formatted as `3` not `03`, so `AMS 5 3` is correct.\n\nCompleting the theorem proof...\n\nI should preserve the `open SimpleGraph Cardinal` statements since they're needed for the declarations, even though some might already be available through ProblemImports.\n\nWriting the Lean file... Defining the chromatic number property for graphs...\n\nNow I'm formalizing the Erdős-Hajnal-Szemerédi Conjecture, which asks whether there's a function that bounds the number of vertices needed to find subgraphs with any desired chromatic number in graphs with chromatic number ℵ₁. The conjecture was disproven by Lambie-Hanson's ZFC counterexample, settling the problem negatively.","signature":"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
