If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied\n   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"82439156-0309-457f-b650-38c323e2fd13"}

Let me analyze problem 45 and apply the DeepMind style guide.\n\n**Problem 45 Analysis:**\n\nThe source file (`conjectures/45.lean`) contains:\n1. A helper `def erdos45_divisors` - gives the \"middle divisors\" of n (divisors strictly between 1 and n)\n2. A theorem `erdos_problem_45` stating: For every k ≥ 2, there exists n such that any k-coloring of D(n) has a monochromatic subset with reciprocal sum = 1.\n\nThe docstring says \"proved by Croot [Cr03]\", so this is **research solved**.\n \nFor the category, I need to decide between AMS 5 (Combinatorics) and AMS 11 (Number theory). The problem involves both k-coloring, which is combinatorial, and divisors, which is number-theoretic. I'll tag it with both: `AMS 5 11`. Since it's attributed to Croot, the category is `research solved`.\n\nSince this is stated as a direct existence result rather than a yes/no question, I don't need the `answer()` function. The namespace will be `Erdos45`, the theorem name `erdos_45`, and I'll keep the definition name as `erdos45_divisors` for clarity, following the pattern from other namespaced definitions. Checking the Mathlib naming convention more carefully—functions returning a Type should use `lowerCamelCase`, so `erdos45_divisors` with its underscore doesn't fit. I'll rename it to `middleDivisors` to match the style guide, though I should be conservative about renaming since the instructions emphasize keeping helper definitions as-is. their docstrings use LaTeX math.\" The name transformation issue: since we're inside `Erdos45` namespace, we could rename to `middleDivisors`. But actually, I want to be careful here - let me just use a reasonable name following convention. `divisors` could be confused with Mathlib's `.divisors`, so I'll use `middleDivisors`.\n\nWait, re-reading the guide: \"3.10 def definitions - Keep all helper definitions.\" It doesn't say to rename them. But the Mathlib convention says Type-returning functions should be lowerCamelCase. The existing name `erdos45_divisors` violates this. I'll rename it to `middleDivisors` for correctness, but I need to update the theorem to use the new name too.\n\nActually, let me keep it simple and just rename it to match convention. Since it's in the `Erdos45` namespace, `middleDivisors` captures the intent well - it represents divisors strictly between 1 and n. I should also add the [Cr03] reference to the module docstring and convert any backtick math to LaTeX format. The copyright year should be 2026 since today is 2026-02-25. Now I'm ready to write out the file with the theorem `erdos_problem_45` as a direct existence statement.\n\nWriting the output file... Writing the Lean file... Defining the theorem statement for Erdos 45...

Now I'm writing out the complete file with the `middleDivisors` definition, making sure the docstring includes the LaTeX math notation for the set of divisors strictly between 1 and n.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1879,"cache_read_input_tokens":36263,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1879,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYVFHVjuKWzezWwdX7ApP","type":"assistant","uuid":"4d366971-cc48-4b08-aadc-51c4330abd5f","timestamp":"2026-02-25T18:18:22.064Z"}
