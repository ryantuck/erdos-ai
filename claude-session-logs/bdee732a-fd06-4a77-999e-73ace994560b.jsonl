`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3281bc93-09ab-4e73-bf27-4fb1a9febdb2"}

Now let me analyze the source file and apply all the transformations.\n\nLet me work through the steps:\n\n## Step 2 — Determine category and `answer()` usage\n\n### 2a. Category\nThe conjecture has been **disproved** (Xichuan found counterexamples). The docstring says \"This conjecture has been DISPROVED.\" So this is `research solved` (informally proved/disproved, widely accepted). Actually wait - it says it was disproved. Let me think about this.\n\nThe problem asks a yes/no question: \"Must there exist a line containing at least two points from A and no points from B?\" And it's been disproved - the answer is no. \n\nSo this is a yes/no question with a known answer of **no** (disproved), which means I should use `answer(False)` and mark it as `research solved`.\n\n### 2b. AMS subjects\nLooking at the mathematical content here—finite point sets, lines, and their geometric relationships—this falls under combinatorial geometry. AMS 52 (Convex and discrete geometry) is the primary fit, though AMS 05 (Combinatorics) could also apply.\n\n### 2c. `answer()` usage\nThe problem is phrased as a yes/no question (\"must there exist a line...\"), and since the Erdős–Purdy conjecture has been disproved, `answer(False)` is the right form to use here rather than a bare assertion.\n\nNow I'm setting up the file structure with the copyright header for 2026, a single import line, the module docstring, and wrapping everything in the `Erdos105` namespace.\n\nI need to add the category annotation referencing AMS 52, name the theorem `erdos_105`, and use `by sorry` for the proof style. For the docstring, I'll convert the mathematical notation to LaTeX format and include a reference to erdosproblems.com/105. So the conjecture was actually disproven—Xichuan came up with three counterexamples that show the n - 3 bound doesn't work. The open question now is whether a weaker version holds, like with n - 4 points in B instead, or more generally with some constant or linear reduction. Hickerson's construction already ruled out n - 2, so we know the threshold is somewhere between there and n - 3.\n\nNow I'm setting up the Lean theorem statement for this problem, specifying that we have two finite point sets A and B in the plane with specific cardinalities, they're disjoint, A is non-collinear, and we need to show there exists a line containing at least 2 points from A while avoiding all points in B. Setting up the Lean file structure with imports and the problem statement for Erdős Problem 105, which involves finding lines through points in two disjoint sets—a conjecture that's been disproved by counterexamples. Still writing the theorem proof...\n\nActually, I should verify the AMS classification for this problem. It's fundamentally about discrete geometry—points and lines in the plane—so AMS 52 is the right fit, though I could argue for adding 05 since it has combinatorial elements. I'll stick with AMS 52 as the primary classification since that's the core mathematical area.\n\nNow I need to think about the imports and open statements. The reference file uses `open Filter` and `open scoped Topology Real`, but the original source doesn't have any opens, which means the necessary types like `Collinear` and `AffineSubspace` must already be accessible through the imports.
