`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources.

It defines:\n   - `SquarePlacement` structure - a square placement in ℝ²\n   - `SquarePlacement.region` - closed region of a square\n   - `SquarePlacement.sqInterior` - open interior\n   - `unitSquare` - the unit square [0,1]²\n   - `IsValidSquareConfig` - valid configuration of n squares\n   - `f` - supremum of total side-length\n   - `erdos_problem_106` theorem - the main conjecture\n\n2. The conjecture states that f(k² + 1) = k for every positive integer k.\n\n**Transformations needed:**\n\n### 3.1 Copyright header\nAdd 2026 copyright header.\n\n### 3.2 Import\nReplace all imports with `import FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n\n### 3.3 Module docstring\nAdd after import with Erdős Problem 106 reference.\n\n### 3.4 open statements\nKeep `open BigOperators Real`\n\n—I need to verify whether ProblemImports already opens these. Looking at the reference file, it uses `open scoped Topology Real`, which suggests `Real` isn't automatically opened. I'll retain both opens to be safe.\n\n### 3.5 Namespace\nWrap in `namespace Erdos106 ... end Erdos106`\n\n### 3.6 Category and AMS\nThe main theorem `erdos_problem_106` represents an open research problem, so I'll mark it as category `research open`.\n\nFor AMS classification, this falls under convex and discrete geometry (52) since packing problems in the plane belong there.\n\n### 3.7 Theorem names\nRename `erdos_problem_106` to `erdos_106`.\n\n### 3.8 sorry style\nReplace bare `sorry` with `by sorry`.\n\n### 3.9 Docstring math\nConvert backtick math notation to LaTeX format in docstrings.\n\n### 3.10 def definitions\nKeep all helper definitions and remove any `noncomputable section` blocks, though they're already individually marked.\n\n### 3.11 References\nThe main docstring references Baek, Koizumi, and Ueoro (2024), so I should consolidate those.\n\n### 2c. answer() usage\nThe conjecture \"f(k²+1) = k for every positive k\" is a direct assertion about equality, not a yes/no question, so `answer()` shouldn't be used.\n\nNow I'm converting the docstrings to LaTeX format, starting with updating mathematical notation like ℝ² to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and other backtick expressions to proper LaTeX. I'm going through the docstrings and converting the inline code notation to LaTeX formatting—replacing backticks around mathematical expressions with proper dollar signs and LaTeX commands like `\\text{}`, `^`, `\\subseteq`, and `\\mathbb{}`. I'm re-reading the problem statement more carefully to make sure I understand the conjecture and what's already been established about it. The conjecture states that $f(k^2 + 1) = k$, meaning you can't do better than $k$ total side-length with one extra square beyond the optimal $k^2$ configuration. The lower bound is straightforward: partition the unit square into $k^2$ equal squares, then subdivide one of them into two smaller squares, which gives you exactly $k$ total side-length. Recent work by Baek, Koizumi, and Ueoro proved this is tight when all squares must be axis-aligned. The closed region occupied by a square placement is defined by translating a point so the center aligns with the origin, rotating it by the negative angle, and checking whether both coordinates fall within the interval from negative half the side length to positive half the side length. I'm noticing the style guide requires LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions in docstrings. The field name references in backticks like `-angle` and the interval `[-side/2, side/2]` should be converted to proper LaTeX notation, and the variable `p` should be formatted as `$p$` as well. The `noncomputable` keyword is already applied to the individual definitions that need it, so there's no section block to clean up. For `unitSquare` and `IsValidSquareConfig`, they're defined as regular `def` statements since they work with sets over reals, which should be fine computationally.\n\nNow I need to fix the proof style—the `sorry` should be changed from `:= sorry` to `:= by sorry` to match Lean conventions. Let me write out the complete file with the proper formatting and license header.\n\nComposing the full file... Defining the square placement structure with center coordinates, side length, and rotation angle, then setting up a function to compute the closed region occupied by a square by translating and rotating points to check if they fall within the square's bounds.\n\nDefining the interior region with strict inequalities... Now I'm defining what makes a valid configuration of n squares—each square must fit entirely within the unit square, and their interiors can't overlap. Then I'm setting up the optimization problem: finding the maximum total side length across all valid arrangements of n possibly-rotated squares. I can see the Lean code defining the problem, and now I'm looking at the mathematical background—establishing that f(k²) = k follows from Cauchy-Schwarz, showing the lower bound f(k² + 1) ≥ k is achievable through a simple subdivision construction, and noting that recent work by Baek, Koizumi, and Ueoro proved the conjecture holds when all squares must be axis-aligned. Packing problems fall under convex and discrete geometry, so AMS 52 is the right classification. The conjecture states an equality rather than posing a question, so I shouldn't use the `answer()` elaborator. I also need to match the reference file's formatting with `:= by` on the same line as the theorem declaration. I'm checking rule 3.11 about references in theorem docstrings—the source already has the inline reference to Baek, Koizumi, and Ueoro, so I don't need to create formal citation keys. The file looks ready to
