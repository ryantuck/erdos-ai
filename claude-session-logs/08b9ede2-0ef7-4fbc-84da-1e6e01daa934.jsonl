`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

-/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ SomeProperty := by\n  sorry\n```\n\nNote that if the statement of the theorem depends on some variables, then the quantification should\nhappen *after* the `answer(sorry)`, i.e.\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n, P n := by\n  sorry\n```\nrather than\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name (n) : answer(sorry) ↔ P n := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n\nWhen the problem is solved:\n- Replace `answer(sorry)` with `answer(True)` or `answer(False)` as appropriate\n- Update the category to `research solved` or `research formally solved ...`\n\n**Note:** Providing a term inside `answer()` does NOT automatically mean the problem is mathematically solved - trivial or tautological answers don't count as solutions.\n\n### File Organization\n\n1. **One problem per file** (with flexibility for closely related variants)\n2. **Copyright header required** (see template in README.md, use year 2026)\n3. **Module docstring** with references:\n   ```lean\n   /-!\n   # Problem Name\n\n   *Reference:* [Title](URL)\n\n   Brief description if needed.\n   -/\n   ```\n4. **Import structure**:\n   - Problem files: Import `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n   - ForMathlib files: Import only necessary Mathlib modules\n5. If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied\n   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"7647e7f6-787c-43a3-a3ae-718a6d66ea3d"}

Let me apply the style guide to problem 86. Let me analyze what needs to be done:\n\n1. **Copyright header** - Add the 2026 Apache License header\n2. **Import** - Replace all imports with `import FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n3. **Module docstring** - Update format to `# Erdős Problem 86` with reference link, and move bibliography references there\n4. **Namespace** - Wrap in `namespace Erdos86 ... end Erdos86`\n5. **Category and AMS** - Add `@[category ...]` to the theorem. This is about graph theory / combinatorics → AMS 5. The problem is open (asking about C4 in hypercube subgraphs). So `@[category research open, AMS 5]`\n\n\n6. **Theorem names** - Rename `erdos_problem_86` to `erdos_86`\n7. **`sorry` style** - The theorem currently has `:= sorry` which needs to become `:= by sorry` to match the style guide.\n8. **Docstring math** - Converting inline math to LaTeX format in the docstrings, starting with `hypercubeGraph86`. I need to decide whether to use `answer()` for this theorem. The original problem is phrased as a yes/no question, but the formalization states it as a direct assertion. Looking at the style guide, `answer()` is for theorems encoding yes/no questions, so I should check if this fits that pattern or if it's better left as a direct positive assertion. I'm structuring the theorem statement with the `answer()` wrapper since this is a yes/no question about an open problem, then laying out the full logical structure with the hypercube subgraph condition and the requirement to find a 4-cycle embedding. I'll keep the graph definitions as individual `noncomputable` declarations rather than grouping them in a section. Since `ProblemImports` likely already provides classical reasoning, I should remove the redundant `Classical.propDecidable` attribute and instead mark the definitions as `noncomputable` individually. I'll keep `open SimpleGraph Finset` for accessibility, and I need to ensure the module docstring includes all the references mentioned in the theorem, like `[Er90][Er91][Er92b][Er93][Er94b][Er95][Er97f]`.\n\nFor the graph definitions, I'm reconsidering whether to keep the \"86\" suffix—since they're namespaced under `Erdos86`, I could simplify them to just `hypercubeGraph` and `cycleGraph` for cleaner naming.\n\nNow I need to consolidate all the references scattered across the module and theorem docstrings into one place at the top, organizing the citations for Erdős's work along with the improvements from Brass, Harborth, Nienborg, Balogh, Hu, Lidicky, Liu, and Baber. Writing the problem statement...\n\nSo the key results are that Erdős established a lower bound of roughly $(\\frac{1}{2} + c/n) n \\cdot 2^{n-1}$, which was then strengthened by Brass, Harborth, and Nienborg to $(\\frac{1}{2} + c/\\sqrt{n}) n \\cdot 2^{n-1}$. On the upper bound side, Balogh, Hu, Lidicky, and Liu showed that $f(n) \\leq 0.6068 \\cdot n \\cdot 2^{n-1}$, and Baber improved this further to approximately $0.60318 \\cdot n \\cdot 2^{n-1}$.\n\nNow I'm defining the hypercube graph structure in Lean, where vertices are binary sequences of length $n$ and edges connect vertices that differ in exactly one coordinate.\n\nFinishing the symmetry proof by showing the filter condition holds in both directions, then establishing that the graph has no self-loops.\n\nDefining the cycle graph $C_m$ on $m$ vertices... Defining the Erdős Problem 86 theorem about hypercube subgraphs and $C_4$ cycles, setting up the formal statement that for any positive epsilon, sufficiently large hypercubes have the property that dense subgraphs must contain 4-cycles.\n\nStill writing the proof structure... I need to keep the `loopless` field exactly as written since the constructor syntax works. For `hypercubeGraph`, I should mark it as `noncomputable` since it relies on decidability that was previously handled by the classical instance we're removing. The `cycleGraph` function should be fine since it only works with `Fin` values and natural numbers. number operations, which should be computable. But the `Adj` uses `≠` on `Fin m`, which has `DecidableEq`, so `≠` is decidable. So `cycleGraph` should be computable. But with `ProblemImports`, if classical instances are globally available, it might still be fine without `noncomputable`. Let me keep `cycleGraph` without `noncomputable` and only mark `hypercubeGraph` as `noncomputable`.\n\nActually, `hypercubeGraph` also doesn't need to be noncomputable if we have decidable equality on Bool and Fin. The `Adj` uses `u ≠ v` (decidable for `Fin n → Bool` if `n` is known and both `Fin n` and `Bool` have decidable eq) and `Finset.filter` with decidable predicates. With `Classical.propDecidable` as a local instance the original made everything noncomputable, but without it and with `ProblemImports` providing classical reasoning, it depends on how `ProblemImports` sets things up. To be safe and follow the style guide about dissolving `noncomputable section` blocks, I'll mark `hypercubeGraph` as `noncomputable` since the original had it in a `noncomputable section`. Now I need to check the `loopless` proof for `hypercubeGraph` — it uses a proof that vertices can't equal themselves, which should work with the decidable equality setup. The outer constructor brackets are probably just how `Irreflexive` is defined as a structure, so I'll leave the proofs as they are. Looking at the actual Mathlib4 definition, `SimpleGraph` has a `loopless` field that expects a proof of `Irreflexive Adj`, which unfolds to `∀ x, ¬r x x` — a function taking any vertex and producing a proof that the adjacency relation doesn't hold reflexively. I see both `loopless` fields in the original file use the `⟨...⟩` constructor syntax, so they must work with the current Mathlib version even though I'm not entirely sure why the anonymous constructor is needed for a `Prop`. Let me just keep them as-is since they're already compiling.\n\nFor the module docstring, I should follow the style from the reference file and change it to `# Erdős Problem 86` without the extra `#`. The existing docstring has good mathematical context, so I'll preserve that while adjusting the header format.\n\nLooking at the style guide requirements for `open` statements, I need to keep `open SimpleGraph Finset` since they're actively used in the definitions, and place them right after the docstring before the namespace declaration.\n\nNow I'm ready to assemble the final file with the copyright header, imports, adjusted docstring, open statements, and the rest of the content.\n\nI'm reconsidering the `loopless` proof syntax—that anonymous constructor pattern seems off for how it's being used here. I'm going to stick with the original code as written since it exists in the repo and was presumably tested, even though I'm uncertain about whether the angle bracket syntax actually works in this context. Let me write out the file

Is it true that every subgraph of $Q_n$ with\n$\\geq (\\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) n \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ many edges contains a $C_4$?\n\nEquivalently, let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of edges in a subgraph of $Q_n$\nwithout a $C_4$.
