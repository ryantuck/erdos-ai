`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

-/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ SomeProperty := by\n  sorry\n```\n\nNote that if the statement of the theorem depends on some variables, then the quantification should\nhappen *after* the `answer(sorry)`, i.e.\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n, P n := by\n  sorry\n```\nrather than\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name (n) : answer(sorry) ↔ P n := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n\nWhen the problem is solved:\n- Replace `answer(sorry)` with `answer(True)` or `answer(False)` as appropriate\n- Update the category to `research solved` or `research formally solved ...`\n\n**Note:** Providing a term inside `answer()` does NOT automatically mean the problem is mathematically solved - trivial or tautological answers don't count as solutions.\n\n### File Organization\n\n1. **One problem per file** (with flexibility for closely related variants)\n2. **Copyright header required** (see template in README.md, use year 2026)\n3. **Module docstring** with references:\n   ```lean\n   /-!\n   # Problem Name\n\n   *Reference:* [Title](URL)\n\n   Brief description if needed.\n   -/\n   ```\n4. **Import structure**:\n   - Problem files: Import `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n   - ForMathlib files: Import only necessary Mathlib modules\n5. If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied\n   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cd107633-cedb-4767-98f2-f7dcf257e7f5"}

Let me apply the style guide to problem 121. Let me walk through each step:\n\n## Step 2 — Category and answer() usage\n\n### 2a. Category\nThe main theorem `erdos_problem_121` formalizes Tao's result which **disproved** the conjecture. Tao proved that for k ≥ 4, there exists c_k > 0 such that F_k(N) ≤ (1 - c_k + o(1))N. This is a solved result — so `research solved`.\n\n### 2b. AMS subjects\n\n\nThis involves products of integers being perfect squares, which falls under number theory, and subsets of {1,...,N}, which is combinatorics. So I'm marking it as AMS 5 and 11.\n\n### 2c. answer() elaborator\nThe original conjecture posed a yes/no question about whether F_{2k+1}(N) = (1 - o(1)) N for all k ≥ 2, but the formalized theorem doesn't use question form — it directly states Tao's upper bound result as a positive assertion. Since it's not phrased as a question, it doesn't need the answer() form per the style guide.\n\n### Step 3 — Write the output file\n\nNow I'm constructing the Lean file for deepmind/121.lean. I'll start with the 2026 copyright header, then add the single import statement for FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports. The module docstring will reference the Erdős problem source and include the bibliographic citations from the original docstring.\n\nFor the open statements, I need to keep both `open scoped BigOperators` and `open Filter` since the source uses the product notation `∏ b ∈ B, b` which requires BigOperators, and the theorem references `atTop` which requires Filter. Then I'll wrap everything in the namespace `Erdos121` and add the category and AMS classification attributes.\n\nFor the theorem itself, I'm renaming it to `erdos_121`, changing the bare `sorry` to `by sorry`, and converting the docstring math notation to LaTeX format — things like `F_k(N)` become `$F_k(N)$` and set notation gets proper LaTeX symbols. I'll keep the helper definitions `noKSquareProduct` and `F` as they are.\n\nNow I need to handle the references. The source cites [Er94b, Er97, Er97e, Er98], [ESS95], [Er38], and [Ta24], which I should pull into the module docstring and reference from the theorem. Let me start writing out the file with the corrected docstring and theorem structure. Tao recently disproved this conjecture by showing that for any k ≥ 4, the density is strictly bounded away from 1, meaning F_k(N) ≤ (1 - c_k + o(1)) N for some positive constant c_k. I need to formalize this result as a theorem and convert the mathematical notation to LaTeX while organizing the references in the module docstring.\n\nNow I'm setting up the Lean file structure with proper imports and documentation... Defining the core properties for this problem. I'm setting up a predicate that checks whether a finset avoids having k distinct elements whose product is a perfect square, then defining F(k, N) as the maximum size of such a subset of {1, ..., N}.\n\nNow I'm formalizing Erdős Problem #121, which asks whether F_{2k+1}(N) grows linearly with N for all k ≥ 2, a conjecture that was later disproved. So Tao's result shows that the density is strictly bounded away from 1 for all k ≥ 4, which settles the conjecture negatively for odd k ≥ 5. Now I'm formalizing this as a theorem in Lean, stating that for any k ≥ 4, there exists a positive constant c such that F_k(N) is bounded by (1 - c + ε)N for sufficiently large N.\n\nI need to verify the imports and naming conventions — checking whether BigOperators is already provided by ProblemImports or if I need to open it explicitly, and making sure the definition names follow the lowerCamelCase convention for Prop-valued definitions. I'm realizing the naming conventions are more nuanced than I initially thought—while Mathlib's style guide says Prop-valued functions should use snake_case, the reference file uses UpperCamelCase for predicates like `IsSumDistinctSet`, which suggests Mathlib actually treats predicate definitions differently from theorem names. I should probably stick with the existing naming in the source file rather than renaming definitions that aren't theorems. for `Prop`-valued definitions that function like type classes or predicates (e.g., `IsSquare`, `IsPrime`). The convention is that `Is*` predicates use UpperCamelCase.\n\nSo `noKSquareProduct` isn't following Mathlib convention exactly... But looking at the guide more carefully:\n\n\"Terms of Props (proofs, theorem names) use snake_case\"\n\"Props and Types (inductive types, structures, classes) use UpperCamelCase\"\n\n`noKSquareProduct` is a `def` that returns `Prop`. It's really a predicate definition. In Mathlib, predicates like `IsSquare` use UpperCamelCase. So `NoKSquareProduct` would be more correct.\n\nBut you know what, looking at the style guide's section 3.10 about `def` definitions, it says to keep all helper definitions and ensure their docstrings use LaTeX math, but doesn't mandate renaming them. And the reference `1.lean` has `IsSumDistinctSet` in UpperCamelCase, which suggests that pattern. I think the safest approach is to rename the Prop-valued definition to follow Mathlib convention: `NoKSquareProduct`. Actually, looking at Mathlib conventions more carefully, predicates starting with \"no\" aren't a standard pattern, so I'll keep the original names. The important renaming is for the theorem itself, which the style guide specifically says should follow snake_case for theorem names like `erdos_<N>`. I'm settling on the main structural changes needed: the copyright header, consolidating imports, adding a module docstring, setting up the namespace, including category and AMS attributes, renaming the theorem, using `by sorry` for the proof, and making sure LaTeX notation like `\\asymp` and `\\pmod` is correct in the docstrings. Let me also check how the references should be formatted — looking at the example file, the citations appear inline within the theorem docstrings rather than at the module level, so I'll follow that pattern. a reference if one is available (e.g. citation keys from the source docstring). Ensure these keys are also explained or listed in the module docstring.\"\n\nAnd section 3.3 says:\n\"If the source file's top-level docstring contains bibliographic entries (e.g. [Er55c] citations) that are referenced from theorem docstrings, move them into the module docstring so all references are consolidated there.\"\n\nSo I need to put the reference details in the module docstring, and have the theorem docstring reference them by key.\n\nThe source has these references: [Er94b, Er97, Er97e, Er98], [ESS95], [Er38], [Ta24]\n\nI don't have the full bibliographic details for all of these, but I can provide reasonable descriptions based on what's in the source. Let me look at what information the source provides and construct reasonable entries.\n\nFrom the source, I can see that [Er94b, Er97, Er97e, Er98] are Erdős papers where the problem appears, [ESS95] is the Erdős-Sós-Sárközy paper that proved the F_2 and F_3 results, [Er38] is Erdős's 1938 paper proving F_4(N) = o(N), and [Ta24] is Tao's 2024 paper disproving the conjecture. I'll write sensible reference entries following the erdosproblems.com convention for citation keys.\n\nNow I'm ready to write the file with the consolidated references in the module docstring.\n\nOne thing to clarify: the source uses `noncomputable def F` rather than a `noncomputable section`, so I don't need to dissolve anything—the definitions are already individual. Also, since the source uses `atTop` which belongs to the `Filter` namespace, I should keep `open Filter` in the imports.\n\nWriting the Lean file with proper structure... Now I'm defining the core mathematical structures for this problem. I'm setting up a predicate that checks whether a finset has the property that no k distinct elements multiply to form a perfect square, and then defining F(k, N) as the maximum size of such a subset within the range {1, ..., N}. Looking at the conjecture more broadly, the question extends to whether $F_{2k+1}(N) = (1 - o(1)) N$ holds for all $k \\geq 2$. The background shows that Erdős, Sós, and Sárközy established results for small cases and even $k$, but Tao recently disproved the conjecture by showing that for any $k \\geq 4$, there exists a counterexample.\n\nTao proved that for each $k \\geq 4$, we can find a constant $c_k > 0$ such that $F_k(N) \\leq (1 - c_k + o(1)) N$, meaning the density of the largest set is strictly bounded away from 1, which refutes the conjecture for all odd $k \\geq 5$. I'm now formalizing this result as a theorem, establishing that for any $k \\geq 4$, there exists such a constant with the appropriate bounds on
