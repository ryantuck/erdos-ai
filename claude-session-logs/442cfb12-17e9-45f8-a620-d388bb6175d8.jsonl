Use Step 2 to choose the correct value per theorem.\n\n### 3.7 Theorem names\n\n- Rename the primary theorem to `erdos_<N>`.\n- Rename variants to `erdos_<N>.variants.<description>` following the pattern in `1.lean`.\n- Follow Mathlib naming conventions: theorem names in `snake_case`.\n\n### 3.8 `sorry` style\n\nReplace bare `sorry` with `by sorry` in all theorem bodies.\n\n### 3.9 Docstring math\n\n- Convert inline backtick math like `` `n ≡ a (mod m)` `` to LaTeX `$n \\equiv a \\pmod{m}$`.\n- Convert display math to `$$...$$` blocks where appropriate.\n- All mathematical expressions in docstrings should use LaTeX, not Unicode-only notation.\n\n### 3.10 `def` definitions\n\n- Keep all helper definitions.\n- Ensure their docstrings use LaTeX math.\n- Do **not** add `@[category]` attributes to `def`s — only to `theorem`s and `lemma`s.\n- Dissolve `noncomputable section ... end` blocks: instead, mark individual `def`s as\n  `noncomputable` where required (i.e. when they involve `ℝ`, `ℂ`, or other non-computable types).\n\n### 3.11 References in theorem docstrings\n\nEach main theorem or lemma docstring should contain a reference if one is available\n(e.g. citation keys from the source docstring). Ensure these keys are also explained or\nlisted in the module docstring.\n\n## Step 4 — Report\n\nAfter writing the file, briefly summarize:\n- The file path written (`deepmind/<N>.lean`)\n- The category assigned to each theorem and why\n- The AMS subject(s) chosen and why\n- Whether `answer()` was used and why (or why not)\n- Any other judgment calls made\n","numLines":176,"startLine":1,"totalLines":176}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"4c1f789a-b897-4ad3-ba30-3ae532a94cfd"}

`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources.

Now let me analyze the source and apply the transformations.\n\nLet me analyze the problem:\n\n**Source file**: `conjectures/50.lean`\n- Has a definition `totientDensityCount` and one theorem `erdos_problem_50_conjecture`\n- The problem asks about the Euler totient function distribution: Schoenberg proved for every c ∈ [0,1] the natural density of {n : φ(n) < cn} exists, call it f(c). Is it true that f'(x) doesn't exist and is positive anywhere? (i.e., f is singular)\n\n\n- Now I need to apply the structural transformations: add the 2026 copyright header, replace imports with the standard problem imports, add a module docstring referencing erdosproblems.com/50, wrap everything in the Erdos50 namespace, and keep only the necessary opens from the original file.\n\nLooking at the conjecture itself, it asks whether there exist any points where f'(x) is positive. The docstring states that Erdős proved the distribution function is purely singular, which means the derivative is zero almost everywhere. If that's the case, then there are indeed no points where f'(x) exists and is positive—so this appears to be a resolved result, making it `research solved`. The problem is marked as solved since Erdős proved the distribution function is purely singular. For the category, this should be `research solved`. The AMS subjects cover number theory (11) for the Euler totient function and real analysis (26) for distribution functions. On the answer format, I'm reconsidering whether to use `answer(True)` — while the theorem is phrased as a direct assertion rather than a yes/no question, it does encode the answer to whether f has any positive derivatives anywhere, which Erdős established as true. the derivative is non-positive everywhere. Since this is already formulated as a direct assertion rather than a question, I should keep it without the `answer()` wrapper.\n\nLooking back at the guidelines, theorems stated as positive assertions—especially when the answer is established—shouldn't use `answer()`. So I'll rename this to `erdos_50` and keep the structure as-is. The `totientDensityCount` definition is already marked `noncomputable`, which is correct since it involves real number comparisons, so I don't need to adjust that.\n\nNow I need to convert the docstring math notation to proper LaTeX formatting and fix the `sorry` to use `by sorry` instead. I'm also checking which `open` statements are actually needed versus what's already imported from the problem setup. I need to figure out which namespaces to open for this problem. The theorem needs `Icc` from `Set` and `Tendsto` from `Filter`, while the definition uses `Finset.range`, `Finset.filter`, and `Nat.totient`. I could qualify these names, but following the pattern from the reference file, I'll open `Finset`, `Filter`, and `Set` to keep the code clean, and skip `Classical` since `ProblemImports` likely handles that already. I'm converting the docstrings to use LaTeX formatting for mathematical notation, then drafting the Lean file with the proper copyright header and imports. I'm defining a function that counts how many natural numbers up to N have a totient value less than c times n, then filtering and counting those that satisfy the condition. Now I'm setting up the main theorem about Erdős Problem 50, which concerns whether the distribution function of numbers with small totient values has any points where its derivative exists and is positive. I'm debating whether to keep the qualified names like `Finset.range` and `Nat.totient` for consistency with the reference style, since opening the namespaces doesn't break qualified access anyway—either approach works fine, so I'll stick with the original qualified form.\n\nNow I'm checking whether `Classical` is needed for the `filter` operation to work. The predicate involves a real number comparison which isn't decidable without classical reasoning, and the import should already provide the necessary instances, so I probably don't need to explicitly open `Classical`.\n\nActually, looking at the original source, it does open `Classical`, and since I can't verify what `ProblemImports` includes, I'll keep it for safety. I'm settling on the same imports as before: `Nat`, `Finset`, `Filter`, `Set`, and `Classical`, plus `scoped Topology` for the `nhds`
