`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

-/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ SomeProperty := by\n  sorry\n```\n\nNote that if the statement of the theorem depends on some variables, then the quantification should\nhappen *after* the `answer(sorry)`, i.e.\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n, P n := by\n  sorry\n```\nrather than\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name (n) : answer(sorry) ↔ P n := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n\nWhen the problem is solved:\n- Replace `answer(sorry)` with `answer(True)` or `answer(False)` as appropriate\n- Update the category to `research solved` or `research formally solved ...`\n\n**Note:** Providing a term inside `answer()` does NOT automatically mean the problem is mathematically solved - trivial or tautological answers don't count as solutions.\n\n### File Organization\n\n1. **One problem per file** (with flexibility for closely related variants)\n2. **Copyright header required** (see template in README.md, use year 2026)\n3. **Module docstring** with references:\n   ```lean\n   /-!\n   # Problem Name\n\n   *Reference:* [Title](URL)\n\n   Brief description if needed.\n   -/\n   ```\n4. **Import structure**:\n   - Problem files: Import `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n   - ForMathlib files: Import only necessary Mathlib modules\n5. If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied\n   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources. These should all appear in the module docstring reference list, and\n  ideally each conjecture statement docstring should have a reference.\n- Use namespaces appropriately\n- Test that `lake build` works\n- Add variants in the same file as the main problem\n- Include basic API for new definitions\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing files for examples: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`, `FormalConjectures/Paper/Kurepa.lean`\n- Use `#AMS` command in VS Code to see available subject classifications\n- Refer to [Mathlib naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html)\n- See [main README.md](./README.md) for contribution workflow\n- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for CLA requirements\n\n## Example Template\n\n```lean\n/-\nCopyright YYYY The Formal Conjectures Authors.\n    (Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2026 for work done in 2026)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n-/\n\nimport FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports\n\n/-!\n# Problem Name\n\n*Reference:* [Source Title](https://source-url.com)\n\nBrief description if helpful.\n-/\n\nnamespace ProblemName\n\n/-- Main definition if needed -/\ndef myDefinition (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n\n/-- The main conjecture -/\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : SomeStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n/-- A variant or special case -/\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\nend ProblemName\n```\n","numLines":483,"startLine":1,"totalLines":483}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"2b1b5718-38f6-496c-a29c-4f5d16d1e2e2"}

Let me now apply all the transformations from the style guide to create the file.\n\nLet me analyze the source file `conjectures/127.lean`:\n\n1. **Copyright header**: Need to add with year 2026\n2. **Import**: Replace all imports with `import FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n3. **Module docstring**: Add with reference to erdosproblems.com/127, include the citations [Ed73] and [Al96]\n4. **open statements**: Keep `open Real Filter` — but check if these are made redundant by ProblemImports. I'll keep them since the reference file 1.lean has `open Filter` and `open scoped Topology Real`.\n\n\n5. **Namespace**: Wrap everything in `namespace Erdos127 ... end Erdos127`\n6. **Category and AMS**: This is a graph theory problem about bipartite subgraphs (combinatorics, AMS 5), solved by Alon, so I'll mark it as `category research solved`\n7. **Theorem names**: Rename `erdos_problem_127` to `erdos_127`\n8. **sorry style**: Change the bare `sorry` to `by sorry`\n9. **Docstring math**: Convert backtick math to LaTeX\n10. **def definitions**: The definitions `cutSize`, `maxBipartiteSubgraphSize`, `edwardsLB`, and `f` are already marked `noncomputable`, so I'll leave those as-is\n11. **References**: Move citations to the module docstring\n\nFor the open statements, I'll keep `open Real Filter` since those are needed for the code. Now let me construct the output file...\n\nFor the definitions themselves, none of them need a category marker. But for `erdos_127` (the main theorem), the docstring mentions it was solved by Alon, so that should get marked as `category research solved, AMS 5`. The subject matter is graph theory and combinatorics, which maps to AMS 5.\n\nThe theorem statement is a direct assertion about existence rather than a yes/no question, so I don't need an `answer()` function.\n\nNow I'm converting the mathematical notation in the docstrings to proper LaTeX format—variables like `G`, `S`, `v`, `w` need to be wrapped in dollar signs, and the Edwards lower bound formula needs full LaTeX rendering.\n\nLooking at the reference file's style, I should follow the same LaTeX conventions they use, like `$A$` for variables and `$N \\in \\mathbb{N}$` for set membership. Let me go through each docstring and apply these transformations consistently.\n\nFor the `cutSize` definition, I'm describing what a cut is mathematically—edges with exactly one endpoint in a subset $S$—and explaining how we count them as ordered pairs to ensure each undirected edge is counted exactly once.\n\nFor `maxBipartiteSubgraphSize`, I'm defining it as the maximum cut value across all possible vertex bipartitions, which corresponds to finding the largest bipartite subgraph.\n\nFor `edwardsLB`, I'm starting to state the Edwards lower bound theorem about graphs with $m$ edges...\n\nCompleting that Edwards bound: every graph guarantees a bipartite subgraph with at least $m/2 + (\\sqrt{8m+1} - 1)/8$ edges.\n\nFor `f`, I'm defining it as the maximal excess that holds for all graphs with $m$ edges—essentially measuring how much better than Edwards' bound we can always achieve, which Edwards proved is at least zero.\n\nNow looking at the complete graph $K_n$: it has $\\binom{n}{2}$ edges total, and the maximum bipartite subgraph achieves exactly $\\binom{n}{2}/2$ edges, so the excess is zero.\n\nEdwards established that $f(m) \\geq 0$ always holds, while Alon's work showed the stronger result that $f(n^2/2)$ grows like $n^{1/2}$, and proved the general upper bound $f(m) \\ll m^{1/4}$. I'm setting up the Lean file structure with the Apache license header and importing the necessary utilities, then starting the documentation for Erdős Problem 127 with a reference to the problem source and beginning to compile the academic citations.\n\nDefining the core concept of a cut in graph theory...\n\nNow I'm implementing the function that computes the cut size by counting edges between a vertex subset and its complement, then defining the maximum bipartite subgraph as the largest cut across all possible partitions. Defining the function f(m)... I'm establishing that there exists an infinite sequence of integers where the function f grows without bound, building on Edwards' foundational result that f is always non-negative and Alon's stronger bounds showing f can grow as large as n^(1/2) for certain inputs while remaining bounded above by m^(1/4).\n\nCompleting the proof structure... I'm noticing the reference file uses `open scoped Topology Real` rather than plain `open`, which only exposes scoped instances and notations. For this problem, I have `open Real Filter`, and while I could convert it to `open scoped`, the guide says to preserve the open statements as needed, so I'll keep them as is. The imports should handle the rest.\n\nOn the `sorry` style, the source has it directly after `:=`, and the guide requires converting bare `sorry` to `by sorry`, so I need to make that adjustment.\n\nFor the qualified names like `Filter.Tendsto` and `Filter.atTop`, the source uses fully qualified forms even though `Filter` is opened, so I should stick with that for
