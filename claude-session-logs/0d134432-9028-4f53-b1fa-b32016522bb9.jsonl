`ErdosProblems/` - Problems from [erdosproblems.com](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n  - `Paper/` - Problems from research papers\n  - `Arxiv/` - Problems from arXiv papers (organized by arXiv ID)\n  - `Books/` - Problems from mathematics books\n  - `Wikipedia/` - Problems from Wikipedia\n  - `OptimizationConstants/` - Problems from [Tao's Optimization Constants](https://teorth.github.io/optimizationproblems/)\n  - Other sources as appropriate\n\n- **`FormalConjectures/Util/`**: Repository infrastructure and utilities:\n  - `Attributes/` - Defines the `category` and `AMS` attributes\n  - `Answer.lean` - Implements the `answer()` elaborator for problems requiring answers\n  - `Linters/` - Custom linters for the repository\n  - `ProblemImports.lean` - Standard imports for problem files\n\n- **`FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`**: Definitions, lemmas, and basic API suitable for upstreaming to Mathlib:\n  - **IMPORTANT**: No `sorry` is allowed in this directory\n  - Follows Mathlib's directory structure (e.g., `Topology/`, `Algebra/`, `NumberTheory/`)\n  - Contains supporting definitions and lemmas needed for problem statements\n  - Code here should be of Mathlib quality and eventually PR-able to Mathlib\n\n## Formalisation Conventions\n\n### Namespaces\n\nEach problem file should define its content in a dedicated namespace:\n\n```lean\nnamespace Erdos10\n\n-- definitions, theorems, variants here\n\nend Erdos10\n```\n\nFor variants of a problem, use dotted notation within the same namespace:\n```lean\ntheorem main_conjecture : ... := by\n  sorry\n\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.special_case : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n### The `category` Attribute\n\nEvery theorem/lemma should have exactly one `category` attribute indicating its type:\n\n**Values:**\n- `@[category high_school]` - High school level math problem\n- `@[category undergraduate]` - Undergraduate level math problem\n- `@[category graduate]` - Graduate level math problem\n- `@[category research open]` - Open research problem (no accepted solution exists)\n- `@[category research solved]` - Solved research problem (informal proof widely accepted)\n- `@[category research formally solved using <kind> at \"link\"]` - Formally solved problem\n  - `<kind>` must be one of: `formal_conjectures`, `lean4`, or `other_system`\n- `@[category test]` - Sanity check or unit test for definitions\n- `@[category API]` - Basic theory around a new definition\n\n**Examples:**\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem riemann_hypothesis : ... := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem sanity_check : ¬ SomeBadProperty := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category API]\nlemma basic_property_of_new_definition : ... := by exact ...\n```\n\n### The `AMS` Attribute\n\nEvery problem should have at least one AMS subject classification number from the [AMS MSC2020](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2020.pdf).\n\n**Common subjects:**\n- `3` - Mathematical logic and foundations\n- `5` - Combinatorics\n- `11` - Number theory\n- `14` - Algebraic geometry\n- `54` - General topology\n- `60` - Probability theory\n\nMultiple subjects can be specified:\n```lean\n@[AMS 5 11]  -- Both combinatorics and number theory\ntheorem erdos_problem : ... := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n**In VS Code:** Use `#AMS` command to list all available subjects and their numbers.

-/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ SomeProperty := by\n  sorry\n```\n\nNote that if the statement of the theorem depends on some variables, then the quantification should\nhappen *after* the `answer(sorry)`, i.e.\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name : answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n, P n := by\n  sorry\n```\nrather than\n```lean\n/-- Does $P(n)$ hold for all $n$? -/\n@[category research open]\ntheorem problem_name (n) : answer(sorry) ↔ P n := by\n  sorry\n```\n\n\nWhen the problem is solved:\n- Replace `answer(sorry)` with `answer(True)` or `answer(False)` as appropriate\n- Update the category to `research solved` or `research formally solved ...`\n\n**Note:** Providing a term inside `answer()` does NOT automatically mean the problem is mathematically solved - trivial or tautological answers don't count as solutions.\n\n### File Organization\n\n1. **One problem per file** (with flexibility for closely related variants)\n2. **Copyright header required** (see template in README.md, use year 2026)\n3. **Module docstring** with references:\n   ```lean\n   /-!\n   # Problem Name\n\n   *Reference:* [Title](URL)\n\n   Brief description if needed.\n   -/\n   ```\n4. **Import structure**:\n   - Problem files: Import `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n   - ForMathlib files: Import only necessary Mathlib modules\n5. If a problem fits in several directories then it should stated in one directory rather than copied\n   accross several. In other directories, one can simply add a file with a declaration pointing\n   to the original, e.g.\n   ```lean\n   @[category research open, AMS 11]\n   theorem pointer_to_original : type_of% my_original_theorem := by\n     sorry\n   ```\n   See for example `FormalConjectures/GreensOpenProblems/81.lean`.\n\n### Variants and Related Results\n\nVariants should be in the same file as the main conjecture:\n\n```lean\n@[category research open, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture : MainStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category research solved, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.weaker_version : WeakerStatement := by\n  sorry\n\n@[category test, AMS 11]\ntheorem main_conjecture.variants.small_cases : MainStatement with (n < 100) := by\n  interval_cases n <;> decide\n```\n\n## Lean and Mathlib Style Guidelines\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nFollow [Mathlib's naming conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html). Unlike Lean 3, Lean 4 uses a combination of `snake_case`, `lowerCamelCase`, and `UpperCamelCase`:\n\n#### Capitalization Rules\n\n1. **Terms of Props** (proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   lemma add_comm (a b : ℕ) : a + b = b + a := by sorry\n   ```\n\n2. **Props and Types** (inductive types, structures, classes) use `UpperCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   class HasGδSingletons (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop\n   structure MyStructure where\n     field1 : ℕ\n     field2 : String\n   inductive Color where\n     | Red | Green | Blue\n   ```\n\n3. **Functions** are named the same way as their return values:\n   - A function `A → B → C` is named as though it's a term of type `C`\n   - If `C` is a `Prop`, use `snake_case`\n   - If `C` is a `Type`, use `lowerCamelCase`\n\n4. **All other terms of Types** use `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   def leftFactorial (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∑ i in Finset.range n, i!\n   def myFunction (x : ℕ) : ℕ := x + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **UpperCamelCase in snake_case contexts**: When something named with `UpperCamelCase` is part of something named with `snake_case`, it is referenced in `lowerCamelCase`:\n   ```lean\n   theorem fermat_last_theorem : FermatLastTheorem := by sorry\n   theorem nat_factorial_pos (n : ℕ) : 0 < n! := by sorry\n   ```\n\n6. **Acronyms**: Written as a group in upper-/lowercase depending on the first character:\n   - `LE`, `LT`, `GE`, `GT` (when in `UpperCamelCase` context)\n   - `le`, `lt`, `ge`, `gt` (when in `lowerCamelCase` context)\n\n7. **Structure fields and constructors**: Follow the same rules (1-6) as top-level declarations\n\n#### Common Naming Patterns\n\n- `add_comm`, `mul_assoc` - operation + property\n- `Nat.factorial_pos` - namespace + definition + property\n- `foo_of_bar` - derive `foo` from hypothesis `bar`\n- `bar_iff_foo` - equivalence between `bar` and `foo`\n- `foo_le_bar` - inequality statement\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nSome rare exceptions exist for consistency:\n- `Ne` (not `NE`) follows `Eq`\n- Intervals: `Set.Icc`, `Set.Iic` (capital `I` despite convention)\n- Some legacy structure fields may be lowercase\n\n**Note**: In this repository, most declarations are theorems (terms of Props), so you'll primarily use `snake_case`.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- **Use Unicode math symbols** where appropriate: `∀`, `∃`, `∈`, `⊆`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, etc.\n- **Format code properly**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)\n- **Add docstrings** with the math written in Latex for definitions and main theorems:\n  ```lean\n  /--\n  The left factorial of $n$, defined as $0! + 1! + 2! + ... + (n-1)!$\n  -/\n  def left_factorial (n : ℕ) := ...\n  ```\n- **Use `local notation`** for problem-specific notation within namespaces\n- **Avoid unnecessary type annotations** when Lean can infer them\n- **Use `by` tactic mode** for sorries: `by sorry` (not just `sorry`)\n- **Do not try to add a suggested informal proof for an open research problem**\n- **Avoid using tactics like `native_decide` in proofs**. These are completely banned in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`\n  and may be considered on a case by case basis for in `category test` statements in problem files\n  when the goal is a large computation.\n\n### Imports\n\n- Be specific with imports - don't import more than needed\n- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib, import only from Mathlib\n- In problem files, import only `FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`, unless you are adding a\n   pointer to another problem or need to state an implication.\n\n## Agent-Specific Requirements\n\n### Before Submitting\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n1. **`lake build` MUST pass** without errors before submitting for review\n   - Run `lake build` in the repository root\n   - Fix all compilation errors\n   - Ensure all dependencies are properly imported\n\n2. **`sorry` usage restrictions**:\n   - ✅ **ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjectures/` for benchmark problem statements\n     ```lean\n     @[category research open]\n     theorem open_conjecture : Statement := by sorry\n     ```\n   - ❌ **NOT ALLOWED**: In `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/`\n     ```lean\n     -- WRONG - will be rejected\n     def helper_function : Type := sorry\n     lemma helper_lemma : P := by sorry\n     ```\n   - Exception: `answer(sorry)` is allowed as a placeholder for unknown answers\n\n3. **Completeness**:\n   - No placeholder definitions (e.g., `def foo : Type := sorry`)\n   - No incomplete type annotations or holes\n   - All referenced definitions must exist\n   - All imports must be correct\n\n4. **Clean code**:\n   - Remove commented-out code\n   - Remove debug statements\n   - No unused imports\n   - No unnecessary intermediate definitions\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore considering your work complete, verify:\n\n- [ ] File has correct copyright header (current year)\n- [ ] Module docstring with reference links present\n- [ ] Namespace properly opened and closed\n- [ ] All theorems have `category` attribute\n- [ ] All theorems have at least one `AMS` subject\n- [ ] Names follow snake_case convention\n- [ ] `lake build` succeeds\n- [ ] No `sorry` in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n- [ ] Docstrings present for main definitions\n- [ ] Code properly formatted and readable\n\n### Testing Definitions\n\nWhen adding new definitions to FormalConjecturesForMathlib/, include basic sanity checks:\n\n```lean\n-- In FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Topology/MyDefinition.lean\nclass MyNewClass (X : Type*) : Prop where\n  property : SomeProperty X\n\n-- In FormalConjectures/Paper/ProblemUsingMyDefinition.lean\n@[category test]\ntheorem myNewClass_sanity_check :\n    MyNewClass SomeConcreteType := by\n  constructor\n  exact proof_of_property\n```\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n❌ **DON'T:**\n- Use `sorry` outside of problem statement proofs\n- Create files without copyright headers\n- Forget to add `category` and `AMS` attributes\n- Submit code that doesn't compile\n- Add large proofs (this is a benchmark repository, not a proof repository)\n- Use camelCase for theorem names\n- Create placeholder definitions in FormalConjecturesForMathlib/\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Follow existing file patterns in the repository\n- Keep formalisations clean and minimal\n- Add references to sources.

Now let me apply all the transformations from the style guide to create `deepmind/62.lean`.\n\nLet me analyze the source file and determine the right transformations:\n\n1. **Copyright header**: 2026 (current year)\n2. **Import**: Replace all imports with `import FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`\n3. **Module docstring**: `# Erdős Problem 62` with reference link. I should also include the bibliographic references [EHS74], [Er87] mentioned in the docstrings.\n\n\n4. **Open statements**: Keep `open SimpleGraph Cardinal` - these are likely needed.\n5. **Namespace**: `namespace Erdos62 ... end Erdos62`\n6. **Category and AMS**: The problem involves graph coloring and chromatic numbers in the context of infinite combinatorics, so AMS 5 (combinatorics) is the primary category, with AMS 3 (set theory) as a secondary due to the cardinal arithmetic involved.\n7. **Theorem names**: I'll use `erdos_62` as the primary theorem name and `erdos_62.variants.weak` for the weaker variant.\n\n8. **`sorry` style**: Both theorems need to change from bare `sorry` to `by sorry`.\n\n9. **`answer()` usage**: These theorems are phrased as universal assertions about the existence of graphs with certain properties, which makes them direct positive statements rather than questions. According to the style guide, I shouldn't use `answer()` for theorems already stated as true assertions, so I'll keep them as regular theorem declarations.\n\nActually, wait—the docstrings frame these as \"must there exist...\" which is explicitly a yes/no question form. The style guide is clear that any theorem encoding a yes/no question should use `answer()`. Since these are open problems, I'll use `answer(sorry)` to properly encode them as questions rather than assertions.\n\nWriting the theorem structure with answer form... I'm reconsidering the style guide more carefully—the key distinction seems to be whether the theorem statement itself asserts the conjectured truth or frames it as a question. Since these theorems directly state universal-existential assertions rather than asking \"is this true?\", I shouldn't use `answer()`. But the docstrings do phrase this as an open question, so I need to think through whether the formalization should match that interrogative framing or stick with the direct assertion approach. Looking at the distinction between how problems are phrased—whether as direct assertions like asymptotic bounds or as open questions that could go either way—I should use `answer(sorry)` for problem 62 since it's genuinely asking whether such graphs must exist, making it a true yes/no question rather than a stated positive result.\n\nNow I'm checking the docstrings for mathematical notation that needs LaTeX formatting, particularly the chromatic number references and modular arithmetic expressions. I also need to verify that the function definitions are preserved and confirm the references belong in the module docstring.\n\nFor the file structure, I'm deciding between the strong and weak versions of Erdős problem 62 — the strong version appears to be the primary conjecture based on how it's named in the source, so that should be the main definition with the weak version as a variant. I'm reconsidering the formulation for `answer()`. The source theorems are direct positive assertions about existence, but since these encode yes/no questions—the docstrings literally ask \"must there exist...\"—I should follow the style guide and use `answer(sorry)` rather than bare assertions, acknowledging that these conjectures could potentially be false.\n\nNow I'm setting up the file structure with the copyright header, imports, and documentation for Erdős Problem 62.\n\nDefining the chromatic number property...\n\nNow I'm formalizing what it means for a graph to contain another as a subgraph through an injective structure-preserving map. Then I'm setting up Erdős Problem 62, which asks whether two graphs both having chromatic number ℵ₁ must share a common subgraph with infinite chromatic number. Completing the theorem statement with the subgraph conditions, then moving to the weaker version of the problem which asks whether any two graphs with chromatic number ℵ₁ must share a common subgraph with chromatic number at least 4, noting that Erdős and collaborators established that graphs with chromatic number ℵ₁ always contain arbitrarily large odd cycles. I'm verifying that the definitions don't need `noncomputable` since they all return `Prop`, which is always computable. I should keep the `open` statements for `SimpleGraph` and `Cardinal` since the code relies on them, even though `ProblemImports` might redundantly open some of these—it's safer to be explicit here.\n\nFor the problem formulations, these are genuine yes/no questions with unknown answers, so using `answer(sorry)` is the right approach rather than asserting them directly. Converting to `answer()` form changes the structure significantly - the entire assertion goes behind `↔`. Is this the right approach?\n\nLooking at the style guide example and the quantification rule, wrapping the entire `∀ ... ∃ ...` in the RHS of `↔` is correct. But the reference file's main theorem `erdos_1` doesn't use `answer()` - it states a specific bound directly as a positive assertion. The key difference is that problem 1 asserts a concrete mathematical relationship, while problem 62 is genuinely asking a yes/no question about whether a common subgraph with high chromatic number must exist. That's why `answer()` is appropriate here.\n\nNow I need to verify the naming convention for `containsSubgraph` - the style guide says functions should be named according to their return type, and since this returns a `Prop`, it should follow snake_case as `contains_subgraph`.\n\nFor `HasChromaticNumberAleph1`, I'm realizing this is also a `def` returning a `Prop`, not a type or class, so despite the `Has` prefix convention, it should actually be `has_chromatic_number_aleph1` to match the rule that functions returning `Prop` use snake_case.\n\nBut looking at actual Mathlib patterns like `SimpleGraph.Colorable`, which is a `def` returning `Prop` in UpperCamelCase, the conventions seem inconsistent. The style guide says Props use UpperCamelCase, but I think that refers to the proposition definitions themselves rather than proofs. Since both `HasChromaticNumberAleph1` and `containsSubgraph` are predicates, I should probably keep them consistent—either both UpperCamelCase or both snake_case, following what Mathlib actually does in practice rather than the strict rule. Looking at the Mathlib naming conventions, propositions should use UpperCamelCase, so `HasChromaticNumberAleph1` is correct and `containsSubgraph` should become `ContainsSubgraph`. The style guide emphasizes following snake_case for theorem names specifically, but the def names can stay in camelCase as long as they follow standard Lean 4 conventions, so I'll keep `HasChromaticNumberAleph1` as is. I think I've been conflating two different rules. Rule 2 is specifically about defining Props themselves—the proposition names should use UpperCamelCase. Rule 3 about snake_case applies to proofs, not the definitions. So both `HasChromaticNumberAleph1` and `containsSubgraph` are Prop definitions and should follow UpperCamelCase, meaning I need to rename `containsSubgraph` to `ContainsSubgraph`.\n\nNow I'm checking the style guide for other details—there's no `noncomputable section` block here and the definitions return `Prop` so no `noncomputable` keyword is needed. For the `open` statements, the guide shows they should come before the namespace based on the pattern in 1.lean, so I'll keep them in that order and finalize the file. The set theory aspect with ℵ₁ is pulling me toward including AMS 3, but I think I'm overthinking this. The problem is fundamentally about graph theory and combinatorics, so AMS 5 is the right classification. I'll stick with that to keep it consistent with the reference material.\n\nNow I'm setting up the Lean file structure with the copyright header and imports for the problem.\n\nI'm defining what it means for a graph to have chromatic number ℵ₁ — essentially that it can't be colored with countably many colors but can be with ℵ₁ colors.\n\nDefining the chromatic number property... Formalizing Erdős's stronger conjecture about whether any two graphs with chromatic number ℵ₁ must share a common infinite subgraph, and setting up the theorem statement that will require proving this for arbitrary pairs of such graphs. I'm now formalizing the weak version of Erdős Problem 62, which asks whether two graphs with chromatic number ℵ₁ must share a common subgraph with chromatic number at least 4. The theorem statement sets up the logical equivalence and constraints for this
