Erdős Problem 1096 [EJK90, GWNT91]:

Let $1 < q < 1 + \varepsilon$ and consider the set of numbers of the form $\sum_{i \in S} q^i$
(for all finite $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$), ordered by size as $0 = x_1 < x_2 < \cdots$.

Is it true that, provided $\varepsilon > 0$ is sufficiently small, $x_{k+1} - x_k \to 0$?

Equivalently: there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that for all $q \in (1, 1+\varepsilon)$, the
gaps between consecutive elements of the power sum set tend to zero. We formalize this as:
for every $\delta > 0$, every sufficiently large element of the set has a successor
in the set within distance $\delta$.

Erdős and Joó speculate that the threshold may be $q_0 \approx 1.3247$, the real root
of $x^3 = x + 1$, i.e., the smallest Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number.
