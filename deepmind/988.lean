# Erdős Problem 988

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/988](https://www.erdosproblems.com/988)

If $P \subseteq S^2$ is a subset of the unit sphere then define the discrepancy
$$D(P) = \max_C \left| |C \cap P| - \alpha_C |P| \right|,$$
where the maximum is taken over all spherical caps $C$, and $\alpha_C$ is the
appropriately normalised measure of $C$.

Is it true that $\min_{|P|=n} D(P) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$?

This was proved (in any number of dimensions) by Schmidt [Sc69b].

Erdős Problem 988 [Er64b]:

For every $M > 0$, there exists $N_0$ such that for every finite set $P$ of points
on the unit sphere $S^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with $|P| \geq N_0$, there exists a spherical cap
$C(v,t) = \{x \in S^2 : \langle x, v \rangle \geq t\}$ (with $v$ a unit vector and
$t \in [-1,1]$) such that the discrepancy
$\left||C(v,t) \cap P| - \frac{1-t}{2} \cdot |P|\right| \geq M$.

Here $\frac{1-t}{2}$ is the normalised surface area measure of the cap $C(v,t)$ on $S^2$.
