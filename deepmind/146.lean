Erdős-Simonovits Conjecture (Problem #146) [ErSi84]:
If $H$ is a bipartite graph that is $r$-degenerate (i.e., every induced subgraph of $H$
has minimum degree at most $r$), then
$$\text{ex}(n; H) \ll n^{2 - 1/r}.$$
That is, there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that $\text{ex}(n; H) \leq C \cdot n^{2 - 1/r}$
for all $n \geq 1$.

This is open even for $r = 2$. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov [AKS03] proved the
weaker bound $\text{ex}(n; H) \ll n^{2 - 1/(4r)}$.
