Erdős Problem 102 (Erdős–Purdy):

For fixed $c > 0$, let $h_c(n)$ denote the largest integer $h$ such that: for every
$n$-point set $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with at least $c \cdot n^2$ lines each containing more than $3$ points
of $P$, some line contains at least $h$ points of $P$. (In other words, $h_c(n)$ is the
minimum, over all such configurations $P$, of the maximum collinearity.)

The conjecture is that $h_c(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, i.e., for each fixed $c > 0$ and
each $M \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, every $n$-point configuration
with at least $c \cdot n^2$ four-rich lines must contain some line with at least $M$ points.
