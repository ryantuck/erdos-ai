# Erdős Problem 814

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/814](https://www.erdosproblems.com/814)

Let $k \geq 2$ and $G$ be a graph with $n \geq k-1$ vertices and
$(k-1)(n-k+2) + \binom{k-2}{2} + 1$ edges. Does there exist some $c_k > 0$ such that $G$
must contain an induced subgraph on at most $(1-c_k)n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $k$?

The case $k=3$ was a problem of Erdős and Hajnal [Er91]. The question for general $k$ was a
conjecture of Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp [EFRS90], who proved that such a subgraph
exists with at most $n - c_k\sqrt{n}$ vertices. Mousset, Noever, and Skorić [MNS17] improved
this to $n - c_k \cdot n / \log n$. The full conjecture was proved by Sauermann [Sa19] with
$c_k \gg 1/k^3$.

Erdős Problem 814 [EFRS90][Er91]:

For every $k \geq 2$, there exists $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with at least $(k-1)(n-k+2) + \binom{k-2}{2} + 1$ edges
contains a nonempty vertex subset $S$ with $|S| \leq (1-c) \cdot n$ such that every vertex
in $S$ has at least $k$ neighbors within $S$.
