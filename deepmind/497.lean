The number of antichains in the power set of $\operatorname{Fin} n$ (the Dedekind number $D(n)$).
An antichain is a family $F$ of subsets of $[n]$ such that for all $A, B \in F$,
$A \neq B$ implies $A \not\subset B$.

Erdős Problem 497 (Dedekind's Problem, resolved by Kleitman [Kl69]):
How many antichains in $[n]$ are there? That is, how many families of subsets
of $[n]$ are there such that no member is a subset of another?

Sperner's theorem states that any single antichain has size at most
$\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$. Kleitman proved that the total number of antichains in the
power set of $[n]$ is $2^{(1+o(1)) \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}}$.

Equivalently, $\log_2(D(n)) / \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$.
