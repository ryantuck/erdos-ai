# Erdős Problem 112

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/112](https://www.erdosproblems.com/112)

A problem of Erdős and Rado on directed Ramsey numbers $k(n,m)$: the minimal $k$ such that
any directed graph on $k$ vertices must contain either an independent set of size $n$ or a
transitive tournament of size $m$. Determine $k(n,m)$.

$f : \mathrm{Fin}(|S|) \to S$ such that $G.\mathrm{adj}(f(i), f(j))$ holds
if and only if $i < j$. This encodes a total ordering of $S$ compatible with the
edge relation. -/

Erdős–Rado upper bound (Problem 112) [ErRa67]:
The directed Ramsey number $k(n,m)$ satisfies
$$k(n,m) \leq \frac{2^{m-1} (n-1)^m + n - 2}{2n - 3}.$$
The exact value of $k(n,m)$ remains an open problem.
