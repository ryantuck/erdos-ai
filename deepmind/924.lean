# Erdős Problem 924

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/924](https://www.erdosproblems.com/924)

Let $k \geq 2$ and $l \geq 3$. Is there a graph $G$ which contains no $K_{l+1}$ such that
every $k$-colouring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $K_l$?

A question of Erdős and Hajnal [Er69b][Er75b]. Folkman [Fo70] proved this
when $k = 2$. The case for general $k$ was proved by Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo76].

See #582 for the special case $k = 2$, $l = 3$ and #966 for an arithmetic analogue.

Erdős Problem #924 [Er69b][Er75b]:

For all $k \geq 2$ and $l \geq 3$, there exists a $K_{l+1}$-free graph $G$ such that every
$k$-colouring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic $K_l$.

Proved by Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo76].
