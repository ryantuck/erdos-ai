A simple graph $G$ is $k$-critical if its chromatic number equals $k$ and for every
edge $e$, the graph obtained by deleting $e$ has chromatic number strictly less
than $k$.

**Erdős Problem 1032** [Er93, p.341]:

Is there a constant $c > 0$ such that for arbitrarily large $n$, there exists
a $4$-chromatic critical graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $c \cdot n$?

Known results:
- Simonovits [Si72] and Toft [To72] independently constructed $4$-chromatic
  critical graphs with minimum degree $\gg n^{1/3}$.
- Dirac gave an example of a $6$-chromatic critical graph with minimum degree $> n/2$.
- This problem is also open for $5$-chromatic critical graphs.
