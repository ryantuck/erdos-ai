# Erdős Problem 132

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/132](https://www.erdosproblems.com/132)

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points. Must there be two
distances which occur at least once but between at most $n$ pairs of points?
Must the number of such distances tend to infinity as $n \to \infty$?

Asked by Erdős and Pach. A "limited-occurrence distance" for $A$ is a value
$d > 0$ such that the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ with $x \neq y$ in $A$
and $\mathrm{dist}(x, y) = d$ is between $1$ and $n = |A|$ inclusive.

Hopf and Pannowitz [HoPa34] proved that the largest distance between points
of $A$ can occur at most $n$ times, making it a limited-occurrence distance
whenever it is realized. The question is whether a *second* such distance
must also always exist.

Erdős believed that for $n \geq 5$ there must always exist at least two
limited-occurrence distances. Erdős and Fishburn [ErFi95] proved this for
$n = 5$ and $n = 6$. Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu [CDL25] proved it for
point sets in convex position.
