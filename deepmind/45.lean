The set of divisors of $n$ strictly between $1$ and $n$:
$$D(n) = \{ d \in \mathbb{N} \mid d \mid n,\; 1 < d < n \}$$

def middleDivisors (n : ℕ) : Finset ℕ :=
  n.divisors.filter (fun d => 1 < d ∧ d < n)

/--
Proved by Croot [Cr03]: for every $k \geq 2$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that
for any $k$-colouring of the set $D(n) = \{d : d \mid n,\, 1 < d < n\}$ of divisors of $n$
(excluding $1$ and $n$ itself), there is a monochromatic subset $D' \subseteq D(n)$ whose
reciprocals sum to $1$:
$$\sum_{d \in D'} \frac{1}{d} = 1.$$

theorem erdos_45 :
    ∀ k : ℕ, k ≥ 2 →
      ∃ n : ℕ, ∀ (c : ℕ → Fin k),
        ∃ D' : Finset ℕ, D' ⊆ middleDivisors n ∧
          D'.Nonempty ∧
          (∃ j : Fin k, ∀ d ∈ D', c d = j) ∧
          (∑ d ∈ D', (1 : ℚ) / (d : ℚ)) = 1 := by
