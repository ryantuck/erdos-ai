# Erdős Problem 772

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/772](https://www.erdosproblems.com/772)

Let $k \geq 1$ and $H_k(n)$ be the maximal $r$ such that if $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ has
$|A| = n$ and $\|1_A \ast 1_A\|_\infty \leq k$ (the additive representation function is
bounded by $k$) then $A$ contains a Sidon set of size at least $r$.

Is it true that $H_k(n)/n^{1/2} \to \infty$? Or even $H_k(n) > n^{1/2+c}$ for some
constant $c > 0$?

**Proved**: The answer is yes, and in fact $H_k(n) \gg_k n^{2/3}$, proved by
Alon and Erdős.

/-- A finite set of natural numbers is a Sidon set ($B_2$ set) if all pairwise
sums are distinct: for $a, b, c, d \in S$ with $a + b = c + d$, we have
$\{a, b\} = \{c, d\}$ as multisets. -/
def IsSidonSet (S : Finset ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a ∈ S, ∀ b ∈ S, ∀ c ∈ S, ∀ d ∈ S,
    a + b = c + d → (a = c ∧ b = d) ∨ (a = d ∧ b = c)

/-- The additive representation count: the number of ordered pairs $(a, b) \in A \times A$
with $a + b = m$. The condition $\|1_A \ast 1_A\|_\infty \leq k$ is equivalent to
$\operatorname{addRepCount}(A, m) \leq k$ for all $m$. -/

Erdős Problem 772 (Proved, Alon–Erdős [AlEr85]):

For every $k \geq 1$, $H_k(n) \gg_k n^{2/3}$. That is, for each $k$ there exist $C > 0$
and $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$, every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $|A| = n$ and
additive representation function bounded by $k$ (i.e., $\|1_A \ast 1_A\|_\infty \leq k$)
contains a Sidon subset of size at least $C \cdot n^{2/3}$.
