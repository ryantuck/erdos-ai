Erdős Conjecture (Problem 162) [Er90b, p.21]:

For every fixed $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1/2$, $F(n, \alpha) \sim c_\alpha \log n$ for some
constant $c_\alpha > 0$. That is, the ratio $F(n, \alpha) / \log n$ converges to a positive
constant $c_\alpha$ as $n \to \infty$.

This sharpens the known bound $F(n, \alpha) = \Theta(\log n)$ (established via the
probabilistic method) to an exact asymptotic with a well-defined constant.
