An independent set of a simple graph within a vertex subset $S$:
a subset $I \subseteq S$ such that no two vertices in $I$ are adjacent in $G$.

def SimpleGraph.IndepSetIn {V : Type*} (G : SimpleGraph V)
    (I S : Finset V) : Prop :=
  I ⊆ S ∧ ∀ ⦃u⦄, u ∈ I → ∀ ⦃v⦄, v ∈ I → u ≠ v → ¬G.Adj u v

/--
Let $k \geq 0$. If $G$ is a finite graph such that every induced subgraph $H$ on $n$
vertices contains an independent set of size $\geq (n - k) / 2$, then there exists
a set $S$ of $O_k(1)$ vertices whose removal makes $G$ bipartite.

Equivalently: for every $k$, there exists a constant $C$ (depending only on $k$)
such that for any finite graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, if every vertex subset $S$
contains an independent set of size at least $(|S| - k) / 2$, then $G$ can be
made bipartite by removing at most $C$ vertices.

Proved by Reed [Re99].

theorem erdos_73 :
    ∀ k : ℕ, ∃ C : ℕ,
      ∀ (n : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)),
        (∀ S : Finset (Fin n), ∃ I : Finset (Fin n), G.IndepSetIn I S ∧
          2 * I.card ≥ S.card - k) →
        ∃ T : Finset (Fin n), T.card ≤ C ∧
          ∃ f : Fin n → Bool, ∀ ⦃u v⦄, u ∉ T → v ∉ T → G.Adj u v → f u ≠ f v := by
