# Erdős Problem 622

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/622](https://www.erdosproblems.com/622)

Let $G$ be a regular graph with $2n$ vertices and degree $n+1$. Must $G$ have $\gg 2^{2n}$
subsets that are spanned by a cycle?

A problem of Erdős and Faudree [Er99]. Erdős writes 'it is easy to see' that
there are at least $(1/2 + o(1))2^{2n}$ sets that are NOT on a cycle.

If the regularity condition is replaced by minimum degree $n+1$ then the answer is
no (consider $K_{n,n}$ with a spanning star in each part). Similarly this is false
with degree $n$, as $K_{n,n}$ shows.

This has been resolved by Draganić, Keevash, and Müyesser [DKM25], who prove the
asymptotically tight result that there are at least $(1/2 + o(1))2^{2n}$ subsets
which are spanned by a cycle.

**Erdős Problem 622** [Er99]:

Let $G$ be a $(n+1)$-regular graph on $2n$ vertices. Then for any $\varepsilon > 0$ and
sufficiently large $n$, $G$ has at least $(1/2 - \varepsilon) \cdot 2^{2n}$ subsets that are
spanned by a cycle.

Proved by Draganić, Keevash, and Müyesser [DKM25].
