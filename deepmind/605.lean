# Erdős Problem 605

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/605](https://www.erdosproblems.com/605)

Is there some function $f(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$ such that there exist $n$ distinct
points on the surface of a two-dimensional sphere with at least $f(n)n$ many pairs of
points whose distances are the same?

This was solved by Erdős, Hickerson, and Pach [EHP89], who showed $u_{\sqrt{2}}(n) \asymp
n^{4/3}$ and $u_D(n) \gg n \log^* n$ for all $D > 1$. The lower bound was improved by
Swanepoel and Valtr [SwVa04] to $u_D(n) \gg n\sqrt{\log n}$. The best upper bound for
general $D$ is $u_D(n) \ll n^{4/3}$.

Erdős Problem 605 [Er85]:

There exists a function $f(n) \to \infty$ such that for all $n \geq 2$, one can place $n$ distinct
points on the surface of a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with at least $f(n) \cdot n$ ordered pairs of
points at some common distance. (Equivalently, at least $f(n) \cdot n / 2$ unordered pairs.)
