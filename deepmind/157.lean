/-- An infinite set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is a Sidon set ($B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums
are distinct: whenever $a + b = c + d$ with $a, b, c, d \in A$, we have
$\{a, b\} = \{c, d\}$ as multisets (i.e. either $a = c$ and $b = d$, or
$a = d$ and $b = c$). -/

Erdős Problem 157 [ESS94, Er94b]:

Does there exist an infinite Sidon set which is an asymptotic basis of order $3$?

A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is a Sidon set if all pairwise sums $a + b$ ($a, b \in A$)
are distinct. A set $A$ is an asymptotic basis of order $3$ if every sufficiently large
integer is the sum of $3$ elements from $A$.

Answered YES by Pilatte [Pi23].
