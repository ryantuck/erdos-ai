Is it true that, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is sparse enough and does not cover all residue
classes modulo $p$ for any prime $p$, then there exists some $n$ such that $n + a$
is prime for all $a \in A$?

A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is called "admissible" if for every prime $p$, there exists a
residue class modulo $p$ not represented in $A$. This is a necessary condition
for the translate $A + n$ to consist entirely of primes.

Weisenberg [We24] has shown the answer is no: $A$ can be arbitrarily sparse
and missing at least one residue class modulo every prime $p$, and yet $A + n$
is not contained in the primes for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

We formalize the conjecture for infinite admissible sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.
