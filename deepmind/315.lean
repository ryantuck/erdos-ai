Erdős Problem 315 (Erdős–Graham, 1980):

The Sylvester sequence $(2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, \ldots)$ is defined by $s_0 = 2$ and
$s_{n+1} = s_n^2 - s_n + 1$. It satisfies $\sum 1/s_n = 1$ and
$\lim s_n^{1/2^n} = c_0 \approx 1.264085\ldots$ (the Vardi constant).

The conjecture states: if $a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \ldots$ is any strictly increasing
sequence of positive integers with $\sum 1/a_n = 1$, other than the Sylvester
sequence, then $\liminf a_n^{1/2^n} < c_0$. In other words, the Sylvester (greedy)
representation uniquely maximizes the growth rate $\liminf$.

This was proved independently by Kamio [Ka25] and Li–Tang [LiTa25].
