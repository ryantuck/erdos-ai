Erdős Problem 744 (Disproved) [Er81, EHS82]:

The original conjecture asked: is it true that $f_k(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ for $k \ge 4$?
In particular, is it true that $f_4(n) \gg \log n$?

Rödl and Tuza [RoTu85] disproved this by showing that $f_k(n) = \binom{k-1}{2}$
for all sufficiently large $n$.
