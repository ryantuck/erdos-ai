# Erdős Problem 532

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/532](https://www.erdosproblems.com/532)

If $\mathbb{N}$ is 2-coloured then is there some infinite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$
such that all finite subset sums $\sum_{n\in S}n$ (as $S$ ranges over all non-empty
finite subsets of $A$) are monochromatic?

In other words, must some colour class be an IP set. Asked by Graham and Rothschild.

Proved by Hindman [Hi74] for any number of colours. This is now known as
**Hindman's theorem** (or the Finite Sums theorem).

See also [531] for the finite version (Folkman numbers).

/-- **Hindman's theorem** (Erdős Problem 532, [Hi74]):
For any 2-colouring $\chi$ of the natural numbers, there exists an infinite set
$A$ of positive naturals such that all non-empty finite subset sums of elements
of $A$ are monochromatic. -/
