# Erdős Problem 742

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/742](https://www.erdosproblems.com/742)

A conjecture of Murty and Plesnik (see [CaHa79]), also attributed to Ore.
The complete bipartite graph shows that this would be best possible.
This is true (for sufficiently large $n$) and was proved by Füredi [Fu92].

**Erdős Problem 742** [Er81]:

Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with diameter $2$, such that deleting any edge
increases the diameter (either by disconnecting the graph or increasing it
beyond $2$). Then $G$ has at most $n^2/4$ edges.
