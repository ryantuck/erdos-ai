# Erdős Problem 1058

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1058](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1058)

Let $2 = p_1 < p_2 < \cdots$ be the sequence of prime numbers. Are there only
finitely many $n$ such that $n \in [p_{k-1}, p_k)$ and the only primes dividing
$n! + 1$ are $p_k$ and $p_{k+1}$?

A conjecture of Erdős and Stewart, as reported in problem A2 of Guy's
collection [Gu04]. The only known cases are $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.

Luca [Lu01] proved that indeed these are the only solutions.

Erdős Problem 1058 (Erdős–Stewart conjecture):

There are only finitely many natural numbers $n$ such that every prime
divisor of $n! + 1$ belongs to $\{q, r\}$, where $q$ is the smallest prime
greater than $n$ and $r$ is the smallest prime greater than $q$.

Equivalently, if $p_{k-1} \le n < p_k$ in the sequence of primes,
then $n! + 1$ has no prime factor other than $p_k$ and $p_{k+1}$.

Proved by Luca [Lu01] (2001): the only solutions are $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.

theorem erdos_1058 :
    Set.Finite {n : ℕ | ∃ (q r : ℕ),
      -- q is the smallest prime strictly greater than n
      Nat.Prime q ∧ n < q ∧ (∀ p, Nat.Prime p → n < p → q ≤ p) ∧
      -- r is the next prime after q
      Nat.Prime r ∧ q < r ∧ (∀ p, Nat.Prime p → q < p → r ≤ p) ∧
      -- every prime factor of n! + 1 is either q or r
      (∀ p, Nat.Prime p → p ∣ (n.factorial + 1) → p = q ∨ p = r)} := by
