# Erdős Problem 652

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/652](https://www.erdosproblems.com/652)

Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and let
$R(x_i) = \#\{ |x_j - x_i| : j \neq i \}$, where the points are ordered such that
$R(x_1) \leq \cdots \leq R(x_n)$.

Let $\alpha_k$ be minimal such that, for all large enough $n$, there exists a set of
$n$ points with $R(x_k) < \alpha_k n^{1/2}$.

Is it true that $\alpha_k \to \infty$ as $k \to \infty$?

This was proved in the affirmative. Mathialagan [Ma21] showed that given sets $P$
($k$ points) and $Q$ ($n$ points) with $2 \leq k \leq n^{1/3}$, some point of $P$
determines $\gg (kn)^{1/2}$ distances to $Q$, implying
$R(x_k) \gg (kn)^{1/2}$ for $2 \leq k \leq n^{1/3}$.

The number of distinct distances from a point $p$ to other points in a finite set
$S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. That is, $R(p) = \#\{\operatorname{dist}(p, q) : q \in S, q \neq p\}$.

Erdős Problem 652: The conjecture that $\alpha_k \to \infty$ is equivalent to: for every
constant $C > 0$, for all sufficiently large $k$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that
every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has fewer than $k$ points with fewer than
$C\sqrt{n}$ distinct distances to the rest of the set.

This was proved in the affirmative by Mathialagan [Ma21].
