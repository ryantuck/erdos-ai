Let $\delta > 0$. If $n$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with no $K_5$
and at least $\delta n^2$ edges, then $G$ contains a set of $\gg_\delta n$ vertices containing no
triangle.

Equivalently, the conjecture asks whether $\delta_3(5) = 0$, where $\delta_3(5)$ is the
Ramsey-Turán density. This was disproved by Balogh and Lenz [BaLe13], who
showed $\delta_3(5) > 0$. The correct value is $\delta_3(5) = 1/12$.
