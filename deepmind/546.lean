# Erdős Problem 546

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/546](https://www.erdosproblems.com/546)

Let $G$ be a graph with no isolated vertices and $m$ edges. Is it true that
$R(G) \leq 2^{O(m^{1/2})}$?

This is true, and was proved by Sudakov [Su11]. The analogous question for
$\geq 3$ colours is still open. A more precise question is Problem 545.

Erdős Problem 546 [Er84b, p.10]:

Let $G$ be a graph with no isolated vertices and $m$ edges. Is it true that
$R(G) \leq 2^{O(m^{1/2})}$?

Formally: there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for every graph $G$ on $k$
vertices with no isolated vertices, $R(G) \leq 2^{C \cdot \sqrt{m}}$ where $m$ is the
number of edges.

This was proved by Sudakov [Su11].
