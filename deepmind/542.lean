Erdős Problem 542 (proved by Schinzel and Szekeres):
If $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ is such that $\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) > n$ for all distinct
$a, b \in A$, then $\sum_{a \in A} 1/a \leq 31/30$.

The bound $31/30 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5$ is best possible, as $A = \{2, 3, 5\}$ demonstrates.

theorem erdos_542 :
    ∀ (n : ℕ) (A : Finset ℕ),
      (∀ a ∈ A, 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ n) →
      (∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ A, a ≠ b → Nat.lcm a b > n) →
      (∑ a ∈ A, (1 : ℝ) / (a : ℝ)) ≤ 31 / 30 := by
