# Erdős Problem 803

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/803](https://www.erdosproblems.com/803)

We call a graph $H$ *$D$-balanced* (or *$D$-almost-regular*) if the maximum
degree of $H$ is at most $D$ times the minimum degree of $H$.

A problem of Erdős and Simonovits [ErSi70]. Disproved by Alon [Al08], who
showed that for every $D > 1$ and large $n$ there is a graph $G$ with $n$
vertices and $\geq n \log n$ edges such that every $D$-balanced subgraph on $m$
vertices has $\ll m \sqrt{\log m} + \log D$ edges.

/-- A simple graph on `Fin m` is *$D$-balanced* if for every pair of vertices
$u$, $v$, the degree of $u$ is at most $D$ times the degree of $v$. This is
equivalent to: $\max \deg \leq D \cdot \min \deg$. -/

Erdős Problem 803 [ErSi70] (Disproved by Alon [Al08]):

Is it true that there exist absolute constants $D \geq 1$ and $C > 0$ such that
for every $m \geq 1$, there exists $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$, every
graph on $n$ vertices with at least $n \cdot \log(n)$ edges contains a
$D$-balanced subgraph on $m$ vertices with at least $C \cdot m \cdot \log(m)$
edges?
