Erdős Problem 336 [ErGr80, p.51]:

For $r \geq 2$ let $h(r)$ be the maximal finite $k$ such that there exists a basis
$A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of order $r$ (every sufficiently large integer is the sum of at most
$r$ elements from $A$) and exact order $k$ (every sufficiently large integer is the sum of
exactly $k$ elements from $A$).

Find the value of $\lim_{r\to\infty} h(r)/r^2$.

Known bounds: $1/3 \leq \lim h(r)/r^2 \leq 1/2$ (lower bound due to Grekos, upper bound
due to Nash).
