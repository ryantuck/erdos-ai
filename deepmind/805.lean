# Erdős Problem 805

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/805](https://www.erdosproblems.com/805)

For which functions $g(n)$ with $n > g(n) \geq (\log n)^2$ is there a graph on $n$ vertices
in which every induced subgraph on $g(n)$ vertices contains a clique of size $\geq \log n$
and an independent set of size $\geq \log n$?

In particular, is there such a graph for $g(n) = (\log n)^3$?

Erdős–Hajnal conjecture [Er91]: there is no graph on $n$ vertices such that every
induced subgraph on $\lfloor (\log n)^3 \rfloor$ vertices contains both a clique and an
independent set of size $\geq \lceil \log n \rceil$.

Erdős and Hajnal thought there is no such graph for $g(n) = (\log n)^3$.

Alon–Sudakov [AlSu07]: there is no such graph with
$g(n) = c \cdot (\log n)^3 / \log(\log n)$ for some constant $c > 0$.
This strengthens the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture.

Alon–Bucić–Sudakov [ABS21]: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for sufficiently large $n$,
there exists a graph on $n$ vertices satisfying the property with
$g(n) = \lfloor 2^{2^{(\log \log n)^{1/2+\varepsilon}}} \rfloor$.
