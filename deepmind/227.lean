# Erdős Problem 227

Let $f = \sum a_n z^n$ be an entire function which is not a polynomial. Is it true that if
the limit of the ratio of the maximum term to the maximum modulus exists, then it must be $0$?
This was disproved by Clunie and Hayman [ClHa64], who showed the limit can take any value
in $[0, 1/2]$.

Erdős Problem 227 (Disproved):
Let $f = \sum a_n z^n$ be an entire function which is not a polynomial. Is it true that if
$$\lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{\max_n |a_n| r^n}{\max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|}$$
exists then it must be $0$?

This was disproved by Clunie and Hayman [ClHa64], who showed that the limit can take
any value in $[0, 1/2]$.
