**Erdős Problem 657** [Er73, Er75f, ErPa90, Er97e]:

Is it true that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is a set of $n$ points such that every $3$-point
subset determines $3$ distinct distances (no isosceles triangles), then the number of distinct
distances determined by $A$ is at least $f(n) \cdot n$ for some $f(n) \to \infty$?

Equivalently: for every constant $C > 0$, there exists $N_0$ such that every set of $n \geq N_0$
points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no isosceles triangles determines at least $C \cdot n$ distinct
distances.
