# Erdős Problem 706

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/706](https://www.erdosproblems.com/706)

Let $L(r)$ be such that if $G$ is a graph formed by taking a finite set of points $P$ in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ and some set $A \subset (0,\infty)$ of size $r$, where the vertex set is $P$ and
there is an edge between two points if and only if their distance is a member of $A$, then
$\chi(G) \leq L(r)$.

The case $r = 1$ is the Hadwiger–Nelson problem, for which $5 \leq L(1) \leq 7$.

Is it true that $L(r) \leq r^{O(1)}$? That is, does there exist a polynomial bound
on the chromatic number of multi-distance graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as a function of the
number of allowed distances?

Formalized as: there exist constants $C, K \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $r \geq 1$ and all
sets $A$ of $r$ positive real distances, the multi-distance graph on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with
distance set $A$ is $(C \cdot r^K)$-colorable.
