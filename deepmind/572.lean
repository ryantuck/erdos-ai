# Erdős Problem 572

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/572](https://www.erdosproblems.com/572)

Show that for $k \geq 3$,
$$\mathrm{ex}(n; C_{2k}) \gg n^{1 + 1/k}.$$

Here $\mathrm{ex}(n; C_{2k})$ is the Turán extremal number: the maximum number of edges in
an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain the even cycle $C_{2k}$ as a subgraph.

The notation $\gg$ means there exists a positive constant $c > 0$ such that
$\mathrm{ex}(n; C_{2k}) \geq c \cdot n^{1+1/k}$ for all sufficiently large $n$.

A problem of Erdős [Er64c]. The upper bound $\mathrm{ex}(n; C_{2k}) \ll k \cdot n^{1+1/k}$
was proved by Erdős [Er64c] and Bondy–Simonovits [BoSi74]. The matching lower
bound is known for $k = 2$ (Erdős–Klein [Er38]), $k = 3, 5$ (Benson [Be66]),
and $k = 4$ (Wenger). The general case remains open.
