Let $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d \geq 2$. Let $F_f(n)$ be
the greatest prime divisor of $\prod_{m=1}^{n} f(m)$. Is it true that $F_f(n) \gg n^{1+c}$
for some $c > 0$?

Formalized as: there exist constants $c > 0$ and $C > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large
$n$, the greatest prime factor of $\prod_{m=1}^{n} |f(m)|$ is at least $C \cdot n^{1+c}$.

Is it true that $F_f(n) \gg n^d$ where $d = \deg(f)$?

Formalized as: there exists $C > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
the greatest prime factor of $\prod_{m=1}^{n} |f(m)|$ is at least $C \cdot n^d$.
