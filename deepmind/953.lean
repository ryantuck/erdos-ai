# Erdős Problem 953

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/953](https://www.erdosproblems.com/953)

Let $A \subset \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 : |x| < r\}$ be a measurable set with no integer distances,
that is, such that $|a - b| \notin \mathbb{Z}$ for any distinct $a, b \in A$. How large can the
measure of $A$ be?

A problem of Erdős and Sárközi. The trivial upper bound is $O(r)$. Koizumi and
Kovac observed that Sárközy's lower bound from [466] can be adapted to give a
lower bound of $\gg_\varepsilon r^{1/2-\varepsilon}$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$.

See also [465] for a similar problem (concerning upper bounds) and [466] for a
similar problem (concerning lower bounds).

The Lebesgue measure of any measurable set $A \subset B(0, r)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no integer
distances is $O(r)$. That is, there exists an absolute constant $C > 0$ such that
for all $r > 0$ and all such $A$, $\mu(A) \leq C \cdot r$.

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $r$,
there exists a measurable set $A \subset B(0, r)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no integer distances
and $\mu(A) \geq c \cdot r^{1/2 - \varepsilon}$.
