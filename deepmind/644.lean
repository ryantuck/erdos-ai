# Erdős Problem 644

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/644](https://www.erdosproblems.com/644)

Let $f(k,r)$ be minimal such that if $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is a family of sets,
all of size $k$, such that for every collection of $r$ of the $A_i$s there
is some pair $\{x,y\}$ which intersects all of the $A_j$, then there is some
set of size $f(k,r)$ which intersects all of the sets $A_i$.

Known results (Erdős, Fon-Der-Flaass, Kostochka, and Tuza [EFKT92]):
$f(k,3) = 2k$, $f(k,4) = \lfloor 3k/2 \rfloor$,
$f(k,5) = \lfloor 5k/4 \rfloor$, and $f(k,6) = k$.

**Erdős Problem 644, Part 1** [EFKT92][Er97d]:

Is it true that $f(k,7) = (1+o(1))\frac{3}{4}k$?

For every $\varepsilon > 0$ and all sufficiently large $k$, every family of
$k$-element sets in which every 7 members can be hit by a pair has a
transversal of size at most $(3/4 + \varepsilon)k$, and there exists such a
family requiring a transversal of size at least $(3/4 - \varepsilon)k$.
