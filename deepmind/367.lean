Erdős Problem 367 [ErGr80, p.68]:

Let $B_2(n)$ be the 2-full part of $n$ (the product of prime power factors $p^a$
with $a \geq 2$). Is it true that for every fixed $k \geq 1$,
$$\prod_{n \leq m < n+k} B_2(m) \ll n^{2+o(1)}?$$

Equivalently: for every $k \geq 1$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, the product is
$O_{k,\varepsilon}(n^{2+\varepsilon})$.

van Doorn notes that the stronger bound $\ll_k n^2$ holds trivially for $k \leq 2$
but fails for all $k \geq 3$ (in fact the product is $\gg n^2 \log n$ infinitely often
when $k = 3$).
