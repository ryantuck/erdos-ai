# Erdős Problem 877

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/877](https://www.erdosproblems.com/877)

Let $f_m(n)$ count the number of maximal sum-free subsets $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ — that is,
$A$ contains no three elements $a, b, c$ with $a = b + c$, and $A$ is maximal with this
property (no element of $\{1, \ldots, n\} \setminus A$ can be added while preserving sum-freeness).

Is it true that $f_m(n) = o(2^{n/2})$?

Cameron and Erdős [CaEr90] proved that $f_m(n) > 2^{n/4}$. Luczak and Schoen [LuSc01] proved
that there exists $c < 1/2$ with $f_m(n) < 2^{cn}$, resolving the conjecture.
Balogh, Liu, Sharifzadeh, and Treglown [BLST15] proved $f_m(n) = 2^{(1/4+o(1))n}$,
later refined [BLST18] to $f_m(n) = (C_n + o(1)) \cdot 2^{n/4}$.

Erdős Problem 877 [CaEr90][Er98]:

Let $f_m(n)$ count the number of maximal sum-free subsets of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. Then
$$f_m(n) = o(2^{n/2}).$$

That is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $n$,
$$f_m(n) \leq \varepsilon \cdot 2^{n/2}.$$

Proved by Luczak and Schoen [LuSc01], with the sharp asymptotics
$f_m(n) = 2^{(1/4+o(1))n}$ established by Balogh–Liu–Sharifzadeh–Treglown [BLST15].
