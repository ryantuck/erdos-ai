# Erdős Problem 872

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/872](https://www.erdosproblems.com/872)

Consider the two-player game in which players alternately choose integers
from $\{2, 3, \ldots, n\}$ to be included in some set $A$ such that no $a \mid b$ for
$a \neq b \in A$ (i.e., $A$ remains a primitive set — an antichain under divisibility).
The game ends when no legal move is possible.

One player (the Lengthener) wants the game to last as long as possible;
the other (the Shortener) wants it to end quickly.

At least $\varepsilon n$ moves (for some $\varepsilon > 0$ and $n$ sufficiently large)?
At least $(1 - \varepsilon) n / 2$ moves (for any $\varepsilon > 0$ and $n$ sufficiently large)?

Erdős does not specify which player goes first, which may affect the answer.
This is a type of saturation game.

Erdős Problem 872 (weak form) [Er92c, p. 47]:

In the primitive-set saturation game on $\{2, 3, \ldots, n\}$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$
such that, regardless of who moves first, the Lengthener can guarantee
at least $\varepsilon n$ moves for all sufficiently large $n$.

Erdős Problem 872 (strong form) [Er92c, p. 47]:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$ and all sufficiently large $n$, regardless of who moves first,
the Lengthener can guarantee at least $(1 - \varepsilon) \cdot n / 2$ moves in the
primitive-set saturation game on $\{2, 3, \ldots, n\}$.
