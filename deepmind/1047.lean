# Erdős Problem 1047

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1047](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1047)

Let $f \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ be a monic polynomial with $m$ distinct roots, and let $c > 0$ be a
constant small enough such that $\{ z : |f(z)| \leq c \}$ has $m$ distinct connected
components. Must all these components be convex?

A question of Grunsky, reported by Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian [EHP58, p.145].

The answer is no, as shown by Pommerenke [Po61], who proved that for
$f(z) = z^k(z-a)$ with $k$ sufficiently large and $a$ close to $(1+1/k)k^{1/(k+1)}$,
the set $\{ z : |f(z)| \leq 1 \}$ has two components and the one containing $0$ is
not convex.

Goodman [Go66] gave further examples, including $(z^2+1)(z-2)^2$ with explicit $c$.

Erdős Problem 1047 (Grunsky's question, [EHP58, p.145]):

There exists a monic polynomial $f \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ and $c > 0$ such that the sublevel
set $S = \{ z : \|f(z)\| \leq c \}$ has exactly as many connected components as $f$
has distinct roots, yet some connected component of $S$ is not convex.

Disproved by Pommerenke [Po61].
