# Erdős Problem 1079

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1079](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1079)

Let $r \geq 4$. If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\operatorname{ex}(n; K_r)$ edges
then must $G$ contain a vertex with degree $d \gg_r n$ whose neighbourhood contains at least
$\operatorname{ex}(d; K_{r-1})$ edges?

As Erdős [Er75] says 'if true this would be a nice generalisation of Turán's theorem'.

This is true (unless $G$ is itself the Turán graph), proved by Bollobás and Thomason [BoTh81].
Bondy [Bo83b] showed that if $G$ has $> \operatorname{ex}(n; K_r)$ edges then the corresponding
vertex can be chosen to be of maximum degree in $G$.

Erdős Problem 1079 [Er75]:

Let $r \geq 4$. If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\operatorname{ex}(n; K_r)$ edges
then $G$ must contain a vertex $v$ with degree $d \gg_r n$ whose neighbourhood contains
at least $\operatorname{ex}(d; K_{r-1})$ edges.

Formalized as: for every $r \geq 4$, there exists $c > 0$ and $n_0$ such that for all
$n \geq n_0$ and all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices with at least $\operatorname{ex}(n; K_r)$ edges,
there exists a vertex $v$ with degree $d \geq cn$ and at least
$\operatorname{ex}(d; K_{r-1})$ edges among the neighbors of $v$.

Proved by Bollobás and Thomason [BoTh81].
