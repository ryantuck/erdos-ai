Erdős Problem 1048 [EHP58, p.142] (disproved by Pommerenke [Po61]):

If $f \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ is a monic polynomial with all roots satisfying $|z| \leq r$ for some
$r < 2$, must $\{ z : |f(z)| < 1 \}$ have a connected component with diameter $> 2 - r$?

Pommerenke [Po61] proved the answer is no for $r > 1$, showing that if
$f(z) = z^n - r^n$ then $\{ z : |f(z)| \leq 1 \}$ has $n$ connected components, all with
diameter $\to 0$ as $n \to \infty$.

For $0 < r \leq 1$, the answer is yes (also Pommerenke [Po61]).
