A sequence $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is lacunary if it is strictly increasing and there
exists some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $a(k+1) \geq (1 + \varepsilon) \cdot a(k)$ for all $k$.

def IsLacunary (a : ℕ → ℕ) : Prop :=
  StrictMono a ∧ ∃ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 ∧ ∀ k : ℕ, (a (k + 1) : ℝ) ≥ (1 + ε) * (a k : ℝ)

/--
Let $A = \{n_1 < n_2 < \cdots\} \subset \mathbb{N}$ be a lacunary sequence (there exists some
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $n_{k+1} \geq (1+\varepsilon) \cdot n_k$ for all $k$).

Is it true that there must exist a finite colouring of $\mathbb{N}$ with no monochromatic
solutions to $a - b \in A$?

Equivalently, does the Cayley graph on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined by a lacunary set have finite
chromatic number?

This was proved: the answer is yes. Katznelson observed it follows from the
solution to Problem 464 (on the Littlewood conjecture). The best quantitative
bound, due to Peres and Schlag, gives at most $\ll \varepsilon^{-1} \log(1/\varepsilon)$ colours.
