/-- A finite set of natural numbers is a Sidon set (also called a $B_2$ set) if all
    pairwise sums $a + b$ (allowing $a = b$) are distinct: whenever $a + b = c + d$
    with $a, b, c, d \in A$, we have $\{a, b\} = \{c, d\}$ as multisets. -/
def IsSidonSet (A : Finset ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ A, ∀ c ∈ A, ∀ d ∈ A,
    a + b = c + d → (a = c ∧ b = d) ∨ (a = d ∧ b = c)

/-- Two sets $A$, $B$ have disjoint difference sets (intersecting only at $0$):
    $(A - A) \cap (B - B) = \{0\}$. Equivalently, if $a_1 - a_2 = b_1 - b_2$ for
    $a_1, a_2 \in A$ and $b_1, b_2 \in B$, then $a_1 = a_2$ and $b_1 = b_2$. -/
def DisjointDifferences (A B : Finset ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a₁ ∈ A, ∀ a₂ ∈ A, ∀ b₁ ∈ B, ∀ b₂ ∈ B,
    (a₁ : ℤ) - (a₂ : ℤ) = (b₁ : ℤ) - (b₂ : ℤ) → a₁ = a₂ ∧ b₁ = b₂

/-- If $A, B \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ are two Sidon sets such that
    $(A - A) \cap (B - B) = \{0\}$, is it true that
    $$\binom{|A|}{2} + \binom{|B|}{2} \leq \binom{f(N)}{2} + O(1),$$
    where $f(N)$ is the maximum possible size of a Sidon set in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$?

    Here $S$ represents a maximum-size Sidon set in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$, so $|S| = f(N)$.
    The $O(1)$ term is captured by the absolute constant $C$.
