Four points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a "unit square" if, when taken in cyclic order
$a \to b \to c \to d$, all four sides have length $1$ and both diagonals have length $\sqrt{2}$.
The four points must also be pairwise distinct.

def IsUnitSquare (a b c d : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)) : Prop :=
  a ≠ b ∧ a ≠ c ∧ a ≠ d ∧ b ≠ c ∧ b ≠ d ∧ c ≠ d ∧
  dist a b = 1 ∧ dist b c = 1 ∧ dist c d = 1 ∧ dist d a = 1 ∧
  dist a c = Real.sqrt 2 ∧ dist b d = Real.sqrt 2

Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be such that no two points in $S$ are distance $1$ apart.
Then the complement of $S$ must contain four points which form a unit square.

This was proved by Juhász [Ju79], who showed more generally that the complement of $S$
must contain a congruent copy of any set of four points.

theorem erdos_214 :
    ∀ (S : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))),
      (∀ p ∈ S, ∀ q ∈ S, dist p q ≠ 1) →
      ∃ a b c d : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2),
        a ∈ Sᶜ ∧ b ∈ Sᶜ ∧ c ∈ Sᶜ ∧ d ∈ Sᶜ ∧
