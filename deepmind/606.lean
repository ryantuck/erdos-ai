# Erdős Problem 606

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/606](https://www.erdosproblems.com/606)

Given any $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, let $f(n)$ count the number of distinct
lines determined by these points. What are the possible values of $f(n)$?

A question of Grünbaum. The Sylvester-Gallai theorem implies that if the points are not
all collinear (i.e., they determine more than one line), then they determine at least $n$
lines. Erdős showed that, for some constant $c > 0$, all integers in
$[cn^{3/2}, \binom{n}{2}]$ are possible except $\binom{n}{2} - 1$ and $\binom{n}{2} - 3$.

Solved (for all sufficiently large $n$) completely by Erdős and Salamon [ErSa88].

Erdős Problem 606 [ErSa88]:

For sufficiently large $n$, every integer in $[c \cdot n^{3/2}, \binom{n}{2}]$ is achievable
as a line count for some configuration of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, except for
$\binom{n}{2} - 1$ and $\binom{n}{2} - 3$.

Sylvester-Gallai consequence [Er85]:

For any set of $n \geq 2$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that are not all collinear (i.e., they
determine more than $1$ line), the number of distinct lines determined is at least $n$.
