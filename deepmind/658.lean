A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ contains the vertices of an axis-aligned square
if there exist $a, b, d$ with $d \geq 1$ such that all four corners
$(a, b)$, $(a + d, b)$, $(a, b + d)$, $(a + d, b + d)$ lie in $A$.

def ContainsAxisAlignedSquare (A : Finset (ℕ × ℕ)) : Prop :=
  ∃ a b d : ℕ, d ≥ 1 ∧
    (a, b) ∈ A ∧ (a + d, b) ∈ A ∧ (a, b + d) ∈ A ∧ (a + d, b + d) ∈ A

/--
For any $\delta > 0$, for all sufficiently large $N$, if $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}^2$ has
$|A| \geq \delta N^2$ then $A$ must contain the vertices of an axis-aligned square.

This is a problem originally attributed to Graham. The qualitative statement
follows from the density Hales-Jewett theorem proved by Furstenberg and Katznelson.
A quantitative proof was given by Solymosi.
