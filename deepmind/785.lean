# Erdős Problem 785

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/785](https://www.erdosproblems.com/785)

Let $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be infinite sets such that $A + B$ contains all large integers.
Let $A(x) = |A \cap [1, x]|$ and similarly for $B(x)$. Is it true that if
$A(x)B(x) \sim x$ then $A(x)B(x) - x \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$?

Such sets $A$ and $B$ (with all large integers in $A + B$ and $A(x)B(x) \sim x$) are
called exact additive complements. Danzer proved that exact additive complements exist.

The answer is yes, proved by Sárközy and Szemerédi [SaSz94].
Ruzsa [Ru17] has constructed, for any function $w(x) \to \infty$, such a pair
of sets with $A(x)B(x) - x < w(x)$ for infinitely many $x$.

**Erdős Problem 785** (Sárközy and Szemerédi [SaSz94]):

Let $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be infinite sets such that $A + B$ contains all sufficiently
large integers (i.e., $A$ and $B$ are additive complements). If $A(x)B(x) \sim x$
(exact additive complements), then $A(x)B(x) - x \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$.
