# Erdős Problem 922

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/922](https://www.erdosproblems.com/922)

Let $k \geq 0$. Let $G$ be a graph such that every subgraph $H$ contains an independent
set of size $\geq (n - k) / 2$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $H$. Must $G$ have
chromatic number at most $k + 2$?

A question of Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa67b]. This is true, and was proved by
Folkman [Fo70b].

Erdős Problem 922 [ErHa67b]:

If every induced subgraph of $G$ on $n$ vertices has an independent set of
size at least $(n - k) / 2$, then $G$ is $(k + 2)$-colorable.

The condition `2 * T.card + k ≥ S.card` encodes $|T| \geq (|S| - k) / 2$.
