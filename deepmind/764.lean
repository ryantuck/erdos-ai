# Erdős Problem 764

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/764](https://www.erdosproblems.com/764)

A conjecture of Erdős [Er65b][Er70c] on whether the partial sums of the 3-fold additive
convolution $1_A \ast 1_A \ast 1_A$ can have bounded error term around a linear function.
Related to problem 763, which concerns the 2-fold convolution.

Disproved by Vaughan [Va72], who proved the answer is no in a strong form, showing that even
$\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A \ast 1_A(n) = cN + o(N^{1/4} / (\log N)^{1/2})$ is impossible.

Erdős Problem 764 (Vaughan's theorem) [Va72]:

For any $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and any $c > 0$, the partial sums
$\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A \ast 1_A(n)$ cannot satisfy
$\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A \ast 1_A(n) = cN + O(1)$. That is, the error
term $\left|\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A \ast 1_A(n) - cN\right|$ is unbounded.
