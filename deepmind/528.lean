Erdős Problem 528 (Connective Constant for Self-Avoiding Walks):

Let $f(n,k)$ count the number of self-avoiding walks of $n$ steps beginning at the
origin in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ (those walks which do not intersect themselves). The connective
constant $C_k$ is defined as $C_k = \lim_{n\to\infty} f(n,k)^{1/n}$.

Hammersley and Morton [HM54] showed this limit exists. It is trivially true that
$k \le C_k \le 2k-1$. Kesten [Ke63] proved $C_k = 2k - 1 - 1/(2k) + O(1/k^2)$.

The problem asks to determine $C_k$ exactly. We formalize the existence of the
connective constant together with the known bounds $k \le C_k \le 2k-1$.
