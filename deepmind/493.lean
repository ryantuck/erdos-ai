Erdős Problem 493 (attributed to Schinzel):
Does there exist a $k$ such that every sufficiently large integer can be written
in the form $\prod_i a_i - \sum_i a_i$ for some integers $a_i \geq 2$?

The answer is yes with $k = 2$: for any integer $n$ we have
$n = 2 \cdot (n+2) - (2 + (n+2))$.

theorem erdos_493 : answer(True) ↔
    ∃ k : ℕ, ∃ N : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, n ≥ N →
      ∃ a : Fin k → ℤ, (∀ i, a i ≥ 2) ∧
        (∏ i : Fin k, a i) - (∑ i : Fin k, a i) = n := by
