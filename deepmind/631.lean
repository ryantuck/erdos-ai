# Erdős Problem 631

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/631](https://www.erdosproblems.com/631)

The list chromatic number $\chi_L(G)$ is defined to be the minimal $k$ such that for any
assignment of a list of $k$ colours to each vertex of $G$ (perhaps different lists for
different vertices) a colouring of each vertex by a colour on its list can be chosen
such that adjacent vertices receive distinct colours.

A problem of Erdős, Rubin, and Taylor [ERT80]. Thomassen [Th94] proved that
$\chi_L(G) \leq 5$ if $G$ is planar, and Voigt [Vo93] constructed a planar graph
with $\chi_L(G) = 5$.
