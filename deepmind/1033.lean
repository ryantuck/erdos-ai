# Erdős Problem 1033

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1033](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1033)

Let $h(n)$ be such that every graph on $n$ vertices with more than $n^2/4$ edges
contains a triangle whose vertices have degrees summing to at least $h(n)$.
Estimate $h(n)$. In particular, is it true that
$$h(n) \geq (2(\sqrt{3} - 1) - o(1))n?$$

Erdős and Laskar [ErLa85] proved $2(\sqrt{3} - 1)n \geq h(n) \geq (1+c)n$ for some $c > 0$.
The lower bound was improved to $(21/16)n$ by Fan [Fa88].

**Erdős Problem 1033** [Er93, p.344]:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$, every graph on
$n$ vertices with more than $n^2/4$ edges contains a triangle whose vertices have
degrees summing to at least $(2(\sqrt{3} - 1) - \varepsilon) \cdot n$.
