Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that for every $h > 0$, the function
$x \mapsto f(x + h) - f(x)$ is continuous. Is it true that $f = g + \varphi$ for some
continuous $g$ and additive $\varphi$ (i.e., $\varphi(x + y) = \varphi(x) + \varphi(y)$)?

Answered in the affirmative by de Bruijn [dB51].

theorem erdos_907 : answer(True) ↔ ∀ (f : ℝ → ℝ),
    (∀ h : ℝ, h > 0 → Continuous (fun x => f (x + h) - f x)) →
    ∃ g φ : ℝ → ℝ, Continuous g ∧ (∀ x y : ℝ, φ (x + y) = φ x + φ y) ∧
      ∀ x : ℝ, f x = g x + φ x := by
