**Erdős Problem 613** (Original conjecture, DISPROVED):

For $n \geq 3$, every graph $G$ with $\binom{2n+1}{2} - \binom{n}{2} - 1$ edges can be written as
the union of a bipartite graph and a graph with maximum degree less than $n$.

This is false, as disproved by Pikhurko [Pi01].

**Erdős Problem 613** (Disproof, Pikhurko [Pi01]):

There exists $n \geq 3$ and a graph $G$ with $\binom{2n+1}{2} - \binom{n}{2} - 1$ edges that
cannot be written as the union of a bipartite graph and a graph with maximum degree less than $n$.
