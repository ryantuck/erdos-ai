Erdős Problem 78 (Open, \$100 prize):

Let $R(k)$ be the Ramsey number for $K_k$, the minimal $n$ such that every
2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$ contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$.
Give a constructive proof that $R(k) > C^k$ for some constant $C > 1$.

Erdős gave a simple probabilistic (non-constructive) proof that
$R(k) \gg k \cdot 2^{k/2}$. This problem asks for an explicit/constructive
lower bound that is still exponential in $k$.

Equivalently, this asks for an explicit construction of a graph on $n$
vertices which does not contain any clique or independent set of size
$\geq c \cdot \log(n)$ for some constant $c > 0$.

We formalize the core mathematical content: there exists $C > 1$ such that
for all $k \geq 2$, there exists a graph on at least $C^k$ vertices with no
clique or independent set of size $k$ (an independent set of size $k$ in $G$
is a clique of size $k$ in $G^c$). The "constructive" requirement pertains
to the nature of the proof, not the formal statement itself.
