# Erdős Problem 1001

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1001](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1001)

Let $S(N, A, c)$ be the Lebesgue measure of the set of $\alpha \in (0,1)$ such that
$|\alpha - x/y| < A/y^2$
for some $N \leq y \leq cN$ and $\gcd(x,y) = 1$. Does
$\lim_{N \to \infty} S(N, A, c) = f(A, c)$
exist? What is its explicit form?

A problem of Erdős, Szüsz, and Turán [EST58], who proved the formula
$f(A, c) = 12A \log c / \pi^2$
when $0 < A < c/(1 + c^2)$.

The existence of the limit was proved by Kesten and Sós [KeSo66].
Alternative, more explicit proofs were given by Boca [Bo08] and
Xiong–Zaharescu [XiZa06].
