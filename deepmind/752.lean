# Erdős Problem 752

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/752](https://www.erdosproblems.com/752)

A question of Erdős, Faudree, and Schelp. Let $G$ be a graph with minimum degree $k$ and
girth $> 2s$. Must there be $\gg k^s$ many distinct cycle lengths in $G$?

Erdős, Faudree, and Schelp proved it when $s = 2$.

(2008), 357–372.

**Sudakov–Verstraëte Theorem (Erdős Problem 752)** [SuVe08]:

There exists an absolute constant $c > 0$ such that for every finite graph $G$
with minimum degree at least $k$ and girth greater than $2s$, the number of
distinct cycle lengths in $G$ is at least $c \cdot k^s$.
