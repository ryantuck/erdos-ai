/--
A problem of Erdős and Hajnal [Er81b,p.33]. Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be three sets of cardinality
$\aleph_1$. Is it true that, in any $2$-colouring of $A \times B \times C$, there must exist
$A_1 \subset A$, $B_1 \subset B$, $C_1 \subset C$, all of cardinality $\aleph_0$, such that
$A_1 \times B_1 \times C_1$ is monochromatic?

The answer is no. This was disproved by Prikry and Mills in 1978
(unpublished), as reported by Todorčević and Komjáth.
