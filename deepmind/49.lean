# Erdős Problem 49

/--
Let $A = \{a_1 < \cdots < a_t\} \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ be such that
$\varphi(a_1) < \cdots < \varphi(a_t)$, i.e., the Euler totient function is
strictly increasing on $A$ (in the ordering inherited from $\mathbb{N}$).
The primes are such an example.

The conjecture (proved by Tao) is that $|A| \leq (1 + o(1))\pi(N)$, i.e.,
for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $N$, any such $A$
satisfies $|A| \leq (1 + \varepsilon) \cdot \pi(N)$.

theorem erdos_49 :
    ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 →
    ∃ N₀ : ℕ, ∀ N : ℕ, N₀ ≤ N →
    ∀ A : Finset ℕ,
      (∀ x ∈ A, 1 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ N) →
      (∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ A, a < b → Nat.totient a < Nat.totient b) →
      (A.card : ℝ) ≤ (1 + ε) * (Nat.primeCounting N : ℝ) := by
