# Erdős Problem 290

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/290](https://www.erdosproblems.com/290)

Let $a \ge 1$. Must there exist some $b > a$ such that
$$\sum_{a \le n \le b} 1/n = r_1/s_1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{a \le n \le b+1} 1/n = r_2/s_2,$$
with $(r_i, s_i) = 1$ and $s_2 < s_1$?

For example, $\sum_{3 \le n \le 5} 1/n = 47/60$ and $\sum_{3 \le n \le 6} 1/n = 19/20$,
and $20 < 60$.

This was resolved in the affirmative by van Doorn [vD24], who proved $b = b(a)$
always exists and $b(a) \ll a$. More precisely, $b(a) < 4.374a$ for all $a > 1$,
and $b(a) > a + 0.54 \log a$ for all large $a$.

Erdős Problem 290 (Proved) [ErGr80, p.34]:

For every $a \ge 1$, there exists $b > a$ such that the denominator of
$\sum_{n=a}^{b+1} 1/n$ (in lowest terms) is strictly less than the denominator
of $\sum_{n=a}^{b} 1/n$ (in lowest terms).
