Erdős Problem #1154 [Er79h, p.119]:

Does there exist, for every $\alpha \in [0,1]$, a subring of $\mathbb{R}$ with Hausdorff
dimension $\alpha$?

Erdős and Volkmann proved the analogous result for subgroups of $\mathbb{R}$.
Falconer showed that any subring with Hausdorff dimension $\alpha \in (1/2,1)$ cannot be
Borel or Suslin. Edgar and Miller proved that any Borel or analytic subring of $\mathbb{R}$
either has Hausdorff dimension $0$ or equals $\mathbb{R}$. Mauldin proved the result for
subfields assuming the continuum hypothesis.
