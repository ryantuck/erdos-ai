/-- The ordinal partition relation $\alpha \to (\beta, \gamma)^2_3$:
for every 2-coloring of increasing triples from ordinals below $\alpha$,
there is either a homogeneous set of order type $\beta$ for color 0,
or a homogeneous set of order type $\gamma$ for color 1.

A homogeneous set of order type $\delta$ is given by a strictly increasing
function $g$ mapping ordinals below $\delta$ to ordinals below $\alpha$, such that
all increasing triples in the image of $g$ receive the same color. -/

**Erdős Problem #70** [Er87]:

Let $\mathfrak{c}$ be the cardinality of the continuum (viewed as an initial ordinal),
$\beta$ be any countable ordinal, and $2 \le n < \omega$. Is it true that
$\mathfrak{c} \to (\beta, n)^2_3$?
