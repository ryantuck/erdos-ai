An arithmetic progression of length $j$ with first term $a$ and common
difference $d$ lies in $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ if $d \geq 1$ and all terms
$a + id$ for $i < j$ are less than $n$.
-/
def APInRange (n a d j : ℕ) : Prop :=
  d ≥ 1 ∧ ∀ i < j, a + i * d < n

/--
A 2-coloring $f : \mathbb{N} \to \text{Bool}$ of $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ has a monochromatic
$j$-term arithmetic progression in color $c$.
-/
def HasMonoAP (f : ℕ → Bool) (n j : ℕ) (c : Bool) : Prop :=
  ∃ a d, APInRange n a d j ∧ ∀ i < j, f (a + i * d) = c

/--
`VDWProperty j k n` asserts: every 2-coloring of $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ contains
either a monochromatic $j$-AP in one color or a monochromatic $k$-AP in
the other.
-/
def VDWProperty (j k n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ f : ℕ → Bool, HasMonoAP f n j true ∨ HasMonoAP f n k false

/--
The van der Waerden number $W(j, k)$ is the smallest $n$ such that
`VDWProperty j k n` holds. Defined as the infimum of all such $n$.
Van der Waerden's theorem guarantees this set is nonempty for $j, k \geq 1$.
-/
noncomputable def vanDerWaerden (j k : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sInf {n : ℕ | VDWProperty j k n}

/--
There exists a constant $c$ with $0 < c < 1$ such that for all sufficiently
large $k$, $W(3, k) < \exp(k^c)$.

This was first proved by Schoen [Sc21]. The best known upper bound is
$W(3, k) \leq \exp(O((\log k)^9))$ due to Bloom-Sisask [BlSi23], improving
on Kelley-Meka [KeMe23].

theorem erdos_721 :
    ∃ c : ℝ, 0 < c ∧ c < 1 ∧
    ∃ N₀ : ℕ, ∀ k : ℕ, k ≥ N₀ →
    (vanDerWaerden 3 k : ℝ) < Real.exp ((k : ℝ) ^ c) := by
  sorry

/--
$W(3, k)$ grows superpolynomially: for every degree $d$,
$W(3, k) > k^d$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

Green [Gr22] proved $W(3,k) \geq \exp(c(\log k)^{4/3}/(\log \log k)^{1/3})$,
improved by Hunter [Hu22] to $W(3,k) \geq \exp(c(\log k)^2/\log \log k)$.
