Erdős–Simonovits Conjecture (Problem #113) [ErSi84]:
For a bipartite graph $G$ on a finite vertex set, the Turán number satisfies
$$
  \operatorname{ex}(n; G) \ll n^{3/2}
$$
if and only if $G$ is 2-degenerate (i.e., $G$ has no induced subgraph with minimum
degree at least 3).

Here $\operatorname{ex}(n; G) \ll n^{3/2}$ means there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that
$\operatorname{ex}(n; G) \leq C \cdot n^{3/2}$ for all $n$.

DISPROVED by Janzer [Ja23b]: for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a 3-regular bipartite
graph $H$ such that $\operatorname{ex}(n; H) \ll n^{4/3 + \varepsilon}$. Since a 3-regular graph is not
2-degenerate but its Turán number is still $o(n^{3/2})$, the "only if" direction
($\operatorname{ex}(n; G) \ll n^{3/2} \to G$ is 2-degenerate) fails.
