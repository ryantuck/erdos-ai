Erdős Problem 1013 [Er71]:

$$\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{h_3(k+1)}{h_3(k)} = 1,$$

where $h_3(k)$ is the minimum number of vertices of a triangle-free graph with
chromatic number $k$.

Formulated as: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $K_0$ such that for all $k \geq K_0$,
$\left| \frac{h_3(k+1)}{h_3(k)} - 1 \right| \leq \varepsilon$.

theorem erdos_1013 :
    ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 →
    ∃ K₀ : ℕ, ∀ k : ℕ, k ≥ K₀ →
      |(h3 (k + 1) : ℝ) / (h3 k : ℝ) - 1| ≤ ε := by
