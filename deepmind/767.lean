# Erdős Problem 767

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/767](https://www.erdosproblems.com/767)

Let $g_k(n)$ be the maximal number of edges possible on a graph with $n$ vertices
which does not contain a cycle with $k$ chords incident to a vertex on the cycle.

Czipszer proved that $g_k(n)$ exists for all $k$, and in fact $g_k(n) \leq (k+1)n$.
Pósa proved that $g_1(n) = 2n - 4$ for $n \geq 4$.
The conjectured equality was proved for $n \geq 3k + 3$ by Jiang [Ji04].

/-- A graph $G$ contains a cycle with at least $k$ chords incident to a single vertex.
That is, there exists a simple cycle (given by an injective map $f : \operatorname{Fin} m \to V$
tracing consecutive adjacent vertices) and a vertex $f(i_0)$ on the cycle that
is adjacent to at least $k$ other cycle vertices which are not its two
cycle-neighbors. -/

For all $k \geq 1$, $g_k(n) = (k+1)n - (k+1)^2$ for all sufficiently large $n$.
