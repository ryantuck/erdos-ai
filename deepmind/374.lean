There exists a set of $k$ distinct natural numbers with maximum element $m$
whose product of factorials is a perfect square.
Formally: there exist $a_1 < \cdots < a_k = m$ with $a_1! \cdots a_k!$ a square.

Erdős Problem 374 [ErGr76][ErGr80]:

For $m \in \mathbb{N}$, let $F(m)$ be the minimal $k \ge 2$ such that there exist
$a_1 < \cdots < a_k = m$ with $a_1! \cdots a_k!$ a perfect square.
Let $D_k = \{m : F(m) = k\}$.

Conjecture: $|D_6 \cap \{1, \ldots, n\}| \gg n$.

That is, there exists $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
the count of $m \le n$ with $F(m) = 6$ is at least $c \cdot n$.
