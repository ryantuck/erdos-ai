Erdős Problem 483 [Er61, p.233] [Er65, p.188]:

Let $f(k)$ be the minimal $N$ such that if $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ is $k$-coloured then there is a
monochromatic solution to $a + b = c$. The values $f(k)$ are known as Schur numbers.

Estimate $f(k)$. In particular, is it true that $f(k) < c^k$ for some constant $c > 0$?

The best-known bounds for large $k$ are
$$
  380^{k/5} - O(1) \leq f(k) \leq \lfloor (e - 1/24)\, k! \rfloor - 1.
$$
The known values are $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 5$, $f(3) = 14$, $f(4) = 45$, $f(5) = 161$
(OEIS A030126).

We formalize the conjecture: there exists $c > 0$ such that for all $k \geq 1$,
every $k$-coloring of $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ with $N \geq c^k$ has a monochromatic Schur triple.
Equivalently, the Schur number $f(k)$ grows at most exponentially in $k$.
