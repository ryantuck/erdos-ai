# Erdős Problem 612

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/612](https://www.erdosproblems.com/612)

Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices, minimum degree $d$, and diameter $D$.

The original conjecture of Erdős, Pach, Pollack, and Tuza [EPPT89] stated:
- If $G$ contains no $K_{2r}$ and $(r-1)(3r+2) \mid d$ then
  $D \leq \frac{2(r-1)(3r+2)}{2r^2-1} \cdot \frac{n}{d} + O(1)$
- If $G$ contains no $K_{2r+1}$ and $(3r-1) \mid d$ then
  $D \leq \frac{3r-1}{r} \cdot \frac{n}{d} + O(1)$

The first case was disproven for $r \geq 2$ by Czabarka, Singgih, and Székely [CSS21].

The amended conjecture (due to [CSS21]) states that if $G$ contains no $K_{k+1}$ then
$D \leq (3 - 2/k) \cdot n/d + O(1)$.

This is known:
- For $k = 2$ ($K_3$-free), proved in [EPPT89]
- For $3$-colourable graphs (weaker than $K_4$-free), by Czabarka, Dankelmann,
  Székely [CDS09]
- For $4$-colourable graphs (weaker than $K_5$-free), by Czabarka, Smith,
  Székely [CSS23]

It is also known that any connected graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree $d$ has
$D \leq 3n/(d+1) + O(1)$.

**Erdős Problem 612** (Amended conjecture, [CSS21]):

If $G$ is a connected $K_{k+1}$-free graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree $d \geq 1$,
then
$$\operatorname{diam}(G) \leq \left(3 - \frac{2}{k}\right) \cdot \frac{n}{d} + C$$
for some constant $C$ depending only on $k$.
