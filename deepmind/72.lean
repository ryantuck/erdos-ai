# Erdős Problem 72

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/72](https://www.erdosproblems.com/72)

There exists a density-zero set $A$ and a constant $c > 0$ such that every graph with
average degree at least $c$ contains a cycle whose length is in $A$. Proved by
Verstraëte [Ve05]; Liu and Montgomery [LiMo20] showed powers of $2$ work.
Erdős was "almost certain" that powers of $2$ would not work, and offered \$100 for a solution.

Is there a set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ of density $0$ and a constant $c > 0$ such that every graph on
sufficiently many vertices with average degree $\geq c$ contains a cycle whose length is in $A$?

Solved affirmatively by Verstraëte [Ve05] (non-constructive proof).
Liu and Montgomery [LiMo20] proved this holds even when $A$ is the set of powers of $2$.

Liu–Montgomery powers-of-2 variant [LiMo20]: There exists $c > 0$ such that every graph on
sufficiently many vertices with average degree $\geq c$ contains a cycle whose length is a
power of $2$. This is a strictly stronger result than `erdos_72`, giving an explicit
density-zero set.
