A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has natural density zero: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all
sufficiently large $n$, $|A \cap \{0, \ldots, n\}| \leq \varepsilon \cdot n$.

def HasDensityZero (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ N →
    (Set.ncard (A ∩ Set.Iic n) : ℝ) ≤ ε * (n : ℝ)

/--
Is there a set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ of density $0$ and a constant $c > 0$ such that every graph on
sufficiently many vertices with average degree $\geq c$ contains a cycle whose length is in $A$?

Solved affirmatively by Verstraëte [Ve05] (non-constructive proof).
Liu and Montgomery [LiMo20] proved this holds even when $A$ is the set of powers of $2$.
