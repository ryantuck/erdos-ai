Erdős Problem #467 [ErGr80, p. 93]:

For all sufficiently large $x$, there exists a choice of congruence classes
$a_p$ for every prime $p \leq x$, and a decomposition of the set of primes
$\leq x$ into two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, such that for every $n < x$,
there exist some $p \in A$ and $q \in B$ with $n \equiv a_p \pmod{p}$ and
$n \equiv a_q \pmod{q}$.

The note on the website indicates the original source [ErGr80] is ambiguous
about the quantifiers; this formalises the most natural interpretation.
