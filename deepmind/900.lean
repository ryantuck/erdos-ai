Erdős Problem 900 (proved by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi [AKS81]):

There exists $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f(c) \to 0$ as $c \to (1/2)^+$ and
$f(c) \to 1$ as $c \to \infty$, such that for every $c > 1/2$, a random graph
$G(n, \lfloor cn \rfloor)$ with high probability contains a path of length at least
$f(c) \cdot n$.
