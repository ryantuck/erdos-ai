There is no exact covering system with distinct moduli.
That is, there is no finite collection of congruence classes $a_i \pmod{n_i}$ with
distinct moduli $n_i \geq 2$ such that every integer belongs to exactly one of
these congruence classes.

This was proved independently by Mirsky-Newman and Davenport-Rado.

theorem erdos_947 :
    ¬ ∃ (k : ℕ) (a : Fin k → ℤ) (n : Fin k → ℕ),
      (∀ i, 2 ≤ n i) ∧
      (Function.Injective n) ∧
      (∀ x : ℤ, ∃! i : Fin k, (↑(n i) : ℤ) ∣ (x - a i)) := by
