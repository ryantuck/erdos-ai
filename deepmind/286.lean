[ErGr80, p.33] (Proved by Croot [Cr01]):
Let $k \geq 2$. Is it true that there exists an interval $I$ of width $(e - 1 + o(1))k$
and integers $n_1 < \cdots < n_k \in I$ such that
$$1 = \frac{1}{n_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_k}?$$

The answer is yes. For every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $k$, there
exist $k$ distinct positive integers in an interval of width at most
$(e - 1 + \varepsilon)k$ whose reciprocals sum to $1$.

theorem erdos_286 :
    ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε →
    ∃ K : ℕ, ∀ k : ℕ, K ≤ k →
    ∃ S : Finset ℕ,
      S.card = k ∧
      (∀ n ∈ S, 0 < n) ∧
      (∃ a : ℕ, ∀ n ∈ S, a ≤ n ∧ (n : ℝ) ≤ (a : ℝ) + (Real.exp 1 - 1 + ε) * (k : ℝ)) ∧
