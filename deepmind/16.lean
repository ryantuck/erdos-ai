The set of odd positive integers that cannot be expressed as $2^k + p$ for any
non-negative integer $k$ and any prime $p$.

A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has natural density zero if
$|S \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| / N \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$.

A set $AP \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is an infinite arithmetic progression if there exist $a, d \in \mathbb{N}$
with $d > 0$ and $AP = \{a + md \mid m \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

def IsInfiniteAP (AP : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ (a d : ℕ), 0 < d ∧ AP = {n : ℕ | ∃ m : ℕ, n = a + m * d}

/--
The set of odd integers not of the form $2^k + p$ (where $p$ is prime and $k \geq 0$)
is **not** the union of an infinite arithmetic progression and a set of natural density zero.

Erdős [Er95, p.167] asked whether this set equals $AP \cup D$ for some infinite arithmetic
progression $AP$ and density-zero set $D$, calling the conjecture 'rather silly'. Using covering
congruences, Erdős [Er50] showed this set contains an infinite arithmetic progression.
Chen [Ch23] resolved the question negatively.
