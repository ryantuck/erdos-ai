# Erdős Problem 190

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/190](https://www.erdosproblems.com/190)

Let $H(k)$ be the smallest $N$ such that in any finite colouring of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$
(into any number of colours) there is always either a monochromatic $k$-term
arithmetic progression or a rainbow arithmetic progression (i.e. all
elements are different colours). Estimate $H(k)$. Is it true that
$H(k)^{1/k}/k \to \infty$ as $k \to \infty$?

This type of problem belongs to 'canonical' Ramsey theory. The existence
of $H(k)$ follows from Szemerédi's theorem, and it is easy to show that
$H(k)^{1/k} \to \infty$.

/-- A colouring $\chi : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ has a monochromatic $k$-term arithmetic
progression within $\{1,\ldots,N\}$: there exist $a \geq 1$ and $d \geq 1$ such that
$a, a+d, \ldots, a+(k-1) \cdot d$ are all in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ and all share the same colour. -/

Erdős Problem 190 [ErGr80]:

Is it true that $H(k)^{1/k}/k \to \infty$ as $k \to \infty$, where $H(k)$ is the smallest $N$
such that any finite colouring of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ always contains either a monochromatic
$k$-term arithmetic progression or a rainbow arithmetic progression?
