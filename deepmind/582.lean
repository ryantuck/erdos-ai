# Erdős Problem 582

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/582](https://www.erdosproblems.com/582)

Does there exist a graph $G$ which contains no $K_4$, and yet any $2$-colouring
of the edges produces a monochromatic $K_3$?

Existence was proved by Folkman [Fo70]. These are now called Folkman numbers.
The smallest such graph has $N$ vertices where the current best bounds are
$21 \leq N \leq 786$.

There exists a $K_4$-free graph $G$ such that for any $2$-colouring of the edges,
there is a monochromatic $K_3$. Existence was proved by Folkman [Fo70].

We formalize this as: there exists $n$ and a simple graph $G$ on $\operatorname{Fin} n$ that
is $K_4$-free, such that for any subgraph $H \leq G$ (representing one color class
in a $2$-coloring of the edges), either $H$ or the complementary subgraph $G \setminus H$
contains a triangle.
