Erdős Problem 484 (a conjecture of Roth, proved by Erdős–Sárközy–Sós [ESS89]):

There exists an absolute constant $c > 0$ such that, whenever $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ is
$k$-coloured (and $N$ is large enough depending on $k$), there are at least $cN$
integers in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ representable as a monochromatic sum, i.e., as $a + b$
where $a, b \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$ lie in the same colour class and $a \neq b$.

Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós proved this and showed that in fact at least
$N/2 - O(N^{1 - 1/2^{k+1}})$ even numbers are of this form.
