/--
A finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has no $(k+1)$ collinear points if every $(k+1)$-element
subset is not collinear (i.e., no line contains $k+1$ or more of the points).

  ∀ S : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)),
    S ⊆ P → S.card = k + 1 → ¬Collinear ℝ (S : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)))

/--
The number of $k$-rich lines: the number of distinct affine lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that
contain at least $k$ points from $P$.

  Set.ncard {L : AffineSubspace ℝ (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)) |
    Module.finrank ℝ L.direction = 1 ∧
    k ≤ Set.ncard {p : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) | p ∈ (P : Set _) ∧ p ∈ L}}

/--
Let $f_k(n)$ be the maximum number of lines containing at least $k$ points,
over all configurations of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no $k+1$ collinear.
Is it true that $f_k(n) = o(n^2)$ for all $k \geq 4$?

This is a generalisation of Problem \#101 (the case $k = 4$). The restriction
to $k \geq 4$ is necessary since Sylvester showed $f_3(n) = n^2/6 + O(n)$.

Formally: for every $k \geq 4$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for
all $n \geq N$ and every set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no $k+1$ collinear, the
count of $k$-rich lines is at most $\varepsilon \cdot n^2$.
