# Erdős Problem 625

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/625](https://www.erdosproblems.com/625)

The cochromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\zeta(G)$, is the minimum number of colours
needed to colour the vertices of $G$ such that each colour class induces either a
complete graph or an empty graph. Let $\chi(G)$ denote the chromatic number.

If $G$ is a random graph with $n$ vertices and each edge included independently with
probability $1/2$, is it true that almost surely
$$\chi(G) - \zeta(G) \to \infty$$
as $n \to \infty$?

Erdős Problem 625 [ErGi93]:

In the Erdős–Rényi random graph $G(n, 1/2)$ — the uniform distribution over all
labelled simple graphs on $n$ vertices — is it true that the difference
$\chi(G) - \zeta(G)$ tends to infinity almost surely as $n \to \infty$?

Equivalently: for every $M \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $n_0$ such
that for all $n \geq n_0$, the fraction of graphs on `Fin n` with
$\chi(G) - \zeta(G) \geq M$ is at least $1 - \varepsilon$.
