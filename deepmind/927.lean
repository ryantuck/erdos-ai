# Erdős Problem 927

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/927](https://www.erdosproblems.com/927)

Let $g(n)$ be the maximum number of different sizes of cliques (maximal complete
subgraphs) that can occur in a graph on $n$ vertices. Is it true that
$$
  g(n) = n - \log_2 n - \log^*(n) + O(1),
$$
where $\log^*(n)$ is the iterated logarithm (the number of times the logarithm
must be applied before the result is less than $1$)?

DISPROVED by Spencer [Sp71], who proved that $g(n) > n - \log_2 n - O(1)$,
showing the $\log^*$ correction term is unnecessary.

See also [775].

Erdős Problem 927 (DISPROVED by Spencer [Sp71]):

For every $n$, there exists a graph on $n$ vertices with at least
$n - \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor - C$ distinct maximal clique sizes, for some
absolute constant $C$.

This disproves Erdős's conjecture that $g(n) = n - \log_2 n - \log^*(n) + O(1)$,
since $\log^*(n) \to \infty$.
