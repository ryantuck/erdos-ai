# Erdős Problem 388

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/388](https://www.erdosproblems.com/388)

Can one classify all solutions of
$$\prod_{1 \le i \le k_1} (m_1 + i) = \prod_{1 \le j \le k_2} (m_2 + j)$$
where $k_1, k_2 > 3$ and $m_1 + k_1 \le m_2$? Are there only finitely many solutions?

More generally, if $k_1 > 2$ then for fixed $a$ and $b$,
$$a \cdot \prod_{1 \le i \le k_1} (m_1 + i) = b \cdot \prod_{1 \le j \le k_2} (m_2 + j)$$
should have only a finite number of solutions.

Erdős Problem 388 [Er76d] [ErGr80] [Er92e]:

There are only finitely many 4-tuples $(m_1, k_1, m_2, k_2)$ of natural numbers
with $k_1, k_2 > 3$ and $m_1 + k_1 \le m_2$ such that
$$(m_1+1)(m_1+2)\cdots(m_1+k_1) = (m_2+1)(m_2+2)\cdots(m_2+k_2).$$
