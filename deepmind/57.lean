Erdős Problem 57 (Conjectured by Erdős-Hajnal [ErHa66], proved by Liu-Montgomery [LiMo20]):
If $G$ is a graph with infinite chromatic number and $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ are the lengths of
the odd cycles of $G$, then $\sum 1/a_i = \infty$.

We formalize "$\sum 1/a_i = \infty$" as: for any real bound $B$, there exists a finite set $T$
of odd natural numbers, each of which is the length of some cycle in $G$, whose reciprocals
sum to at least $B$.
