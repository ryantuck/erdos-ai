Erdős Problem 1118 — Hayman's conjecture, proved by Camera [Ca77]
and Gol'dberg [Go79b]:

Let $f(z)$ be a non-constant entire function such that for some $c > 0$, the set
$E(c) = \{z : |f(z)| > c\}$ has finite (Lebesgue) measure. Then
$$\int_0^\infty \frac{r}{\log \log M(r)} \, dr < \infty$$
where $M(r) = \max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|$. This growth condition is best possible.

Erdős Problem 1118 — Negative answer to the second question, due to Gol'dberg [Go79b]:

There exists a non-constant entire function $f$ and $c > 0$ such that $E(c)$ has finite
measure, but $E(c')$ has infinite measure for all $0 < c' < c$.

Gol'dberg proved that $T = \{c > 0 : |E(c)| < \infty\}$ can equal $[m, \infty)$ or
$(m, \infty)$ for any $m > 0$.
