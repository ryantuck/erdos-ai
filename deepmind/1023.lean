Erdős Problem 1023 [Er71, p. 105]:

There exists a constant $c > 0$ such that $F(n) \sim c \cdot 2^n / \sqrt{n}$, where $F(n)$
is the maximum size of a union-free family of subsets of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$.

Formulated as: $\lim_{n \to \infty} F(n) \cdot \sqrt{n} \,/\, (c \cdot 2^n) = 1$.

Erdős and Kleitman proved that $F(n) \asymp 2^n / \sqrt{n}$. Hunter observes that the
answer follows from the solution to problem 447, which implies
$F(n) \sim \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$.
