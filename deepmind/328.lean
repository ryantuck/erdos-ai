Erdős Problem 328 [ErGr80, p.48]:

Suppose $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $C > 0$ is such that $1_A * 1_A(n) \leq C$ for all
$n \in \mathbb{N}$. Can $A$ be partitioned into $t$ many subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_t$
(where $t = t(C)$ depends only on $C$) such that $1_{A_i} * 1_{A_i}(n) < C$ for all
$1 \leq i \leq t$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$?

Asked by Erdős and Newman. Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo85] showed the answer is no
for all $C$ (even if $t$ is also allowed to depend on $A$).

We formalize the negation (the true statement): for every $C \geq 1$, there exists
$A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with representation function bounded by $C$, such that for every finite
partition of $A$, some part has representation function $\geq C$ at some $n$.
