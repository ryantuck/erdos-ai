# Erdős Problem 1125

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1125](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1125)

[Ke69] Kemperman, J.H.B., (1969) - proved the result for measurable $f$.

[Er81b] Erdős, P., (1981).

[La84] Laczkovich, M., (1984) - solved the problem in the affirmative.

Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that $2f(x) \leq f(x+h) + f(x+2h)$ for every
$x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $h > 0$. Then $f$ must be monotonic.

A problem of Kemperman [Ke69], who proved it is true if $f$ is measurable.
Laczkovich [La84] solved it in the affirmative.

theorem erdos_1125 :
    ∀ f : ℝ → ℝ,
    (∀ x : ℝ, ∀ h : ℝ, h > 0 → 2 * f x ≤ f (x + h) + f (x + 2 * h)) →
    Monotone f ∨ Antitone f := by
