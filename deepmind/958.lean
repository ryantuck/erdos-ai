# Erdős Problem 958

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/958](https://www.erdosproblems.com/958)

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a finite set of size $n$, and let $\{d_1, \ldots, d_k\}$
be the set of distinct distances determined by $A$. Let $f(d)$ be the multiplicity of $d$,
the number of unordered pairs from $A$ at distance $d$ apart.

Is it true that $k = n - 1$ and $\{f(d_i)\} = \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ if and only if $A$ is
a set of equidistant points on a line or a circle?

Erdős conjectured that the answer is no, and other such configurations exist [Er84c].

This was proved by Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu [CDL25], who observed that equidistant
points on a short circular arc on a circle of radius 1, together with the centre, provide
a counterexample.

**Erdős Problem 958** [Er84c]:

Erdős conjectured that there exists a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ satisfying the
distance multiplicity property (exactly $n-1$ distinct distances with multiplicities
$\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$) that is neither a set of equidistant points on a line nor equidistant
points on a circle.

This was proved by Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu [CDL25].
