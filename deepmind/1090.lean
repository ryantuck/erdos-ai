Let $k \geq 3$. Does there exist a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that, in any
2-colouring of $A$, there exists a line which contains at least $k$ points from $A$, and all the
points of $A$ on the line have the same colour?

The answer is yes. Erdős [Er75f] notes that Graham and Selfridge proved the
case $k = 3$. Hunter observed that for sufficiently large $n$, a generic projection
of $[k]^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^2$ has this property, by the Hales–Jewett theorem.
