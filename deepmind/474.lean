/-- The negative square-bracket partition relation $\kappa \nrightarrow [\mu]_k^2$ for cardinals.

There exists a $k$-coloring of pairs from a set of cardinality $\kappa$ such that
every subset of cardinality $\geq \mu$ contains pairs of all $k$ colors.

In standard Erdős-Rado partition calculus notation, this is
$\kappa \nrightarrow [\mu]_k^2$. -/

Erdős Problem 474 (1954) [Er95d, p.64] [Va99, 7.81]:

Does the negative square-bracket partition relation $2^{\aleph_0} \nrightarrow [\aleph_1]_3^2$
hold assuming $\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_2$?

In words: can the pairs from $\mathbb{R}$ be $3$-colored so that every uncountable
subset contains pairs of each color?

Sierpinski and Kurepa independently proved the $2$-color version
($2^{\aleph_0} \nrightarrow [\aleph_1]_2^2$) holds in ZFC. Erdős proved that under the
continuum hypothesis ($\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_1$), the $3$-color version holds, and offered
100 dollars for deciding what happens without CH.

Shelah [Sh88] showed it is consistent without CH that the positive relation
$2^{\aleph_0} \to [\aleph_1]_3^2$ holds, but with $\mathfrak{c}$ very large.

The specific remaining open question (asked in [Va99]):
Assuming $\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_2$, does $2^{\aleph_0} \nrightarrow [\aleph_1]_3^2$ hold?
