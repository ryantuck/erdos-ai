# Erdős Problem 167

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/167](https://www.erdosproblems.com/167)

Tuza's conjecture (1981): If $G$ is a finite simple graph whose maximum number
of pairwise edge-disjoint triangles (the triangle packing number $\nu(G)$) is at
most $k$, then $G$ can be made triangle-free by removing at most $2k$ edges (the
triangle covering number $\tau(G)$ is at most $2k$).

Equivalently: $\tau(G) \leq 2 \cdot \nu(G)$ for every finite graph $G$.

It is trivial that $\tau(G) \leq 3 \cdot \nu(G)$. The examples of $K_4$ and $K_5$ show that
$2k$ would be best possible. Haxell [Ha99] improved the trivial bound to
$(3 - 3/23 + o(1))k$. Kahn and Park [KaPa22] proved this for random graphs.

Erdős Conjecture (Problem 167) — Tuza's Conjecture [Er88]:

For any finite simple graph $G$, if the maximum number of pairwise edge-disjoint
triangles in $G$ is at most $k$, then $G$ can be made triangle-free by removing at
most $2k$ edges.

Two triangles (3-cliques) are edge-disjoint iff their vertex sets share at most
one vertex, since in a triangle every pair of vertices forms an edge.

The hypothesis states that every family of pairwise edge-disjoint triangles
has size at most $k$. The conclusion states that there exists a subgraph $H \leq G$
that is triangle-free, obtained by removing at most $2k$ edges from $G$.
