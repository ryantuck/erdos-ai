# Erdős Problem 715

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/715](https://www.erdosproblems.com/715)

Does every regular graph of degree $4$ contain a regular subgraph of degree $3$?
Is there any $r$ such that every regular graph of degree $r$ must contain a regular
subgraph of degree $3$?

A problem of Berge (or Berge and Sauer). Alon, Friedland, and Kalai [AFK84]
proved that every $4$-regular graph plus an edge contains a $3$-regular subgraph,
and hence in particular every $r$-regular graph with $r \geq 5$ contains a $3$-regular
subgraph.

The answer is yes, proved by Tashkinov [Ta82].

**Erdős Problem 715** [Er75][Er81]:

Every $4$-regular simple graph contains a $3$-regular subgraph.

A subgraph $H$ of $G$ is $3$-regular if every vertex of $H$ has exactly $3$ neighbours
in $H$. We express this using Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.Subgraph`: there exists a
subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that `H.coe` (the coercion to a `SimpleGraph` on `H.verts`)
is $3$-regular, and $H$ has at least one vertex.

Proved by Tashkinov [Ta82].
