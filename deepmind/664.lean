# Erdős Problem 664

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/664](https://www.erdosproblems.com/664)

Let $c < 1$ be some constant and $A_1, \ldots, A_m \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ be such that
$|A_i| > c\sqrt{n}$ for all $i$ and $|A_i \cap A_j| \leq 1$ for all $i \neq j$.

Must there exist some set $B$ such that $B \cap A_i \neq \emptyset$ and
$|B \cap A_i| \ll_c 1$ for all $i$?

This was disproved by Alon, who showed that for $c = 2/5$ and appropriate families derived
from random subsets of lines of a projective plane, any transversal $B$ must intersect
some $A_j$ in $\Omega(\log n)$ points.

Erdős Problem 664 (Disproved) [Er81][Er97f]:

There exists $c \in (0, 1)$ such that for any bound $K$, there exist $n$, $m$ and a family
$A : \mathrm{Fin}(m) \to \mathrm{Finset}(\mathrm{Fin}(n))$ with $|A_i| > c\sqrt{n}$ for
all $i$ and $|A_i \cap A_j| \leq 1$ for $i \neq j$, such that for every transversal $B$
(meeting every $A_i$), there exists some $j$ with $|B \cap A_j| > K$.

Proved by Alon using random subsets of lines of a projective plane, with $c = 2/5$.
