Erdős Problem 967 (Disproved by Yip [Yi25]):

Let $1 < a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ be a strictly increasing sequence of integers with
$\sum 1/a_k < \infty$. Erdős and Ingham [ErIn64] asked whether it is necessarily true
that for every real $t$,
$$1 + \sum_k a_k^{-(1+it)} \neq 0.$$

Yip proved that for any real $t \neq 0$, there exists such a sequence satisfying
$$1 + \sum_k a_k^{-(1+it)} = 0.$$

It remains open whether this holds for every finite sequence of integers.
