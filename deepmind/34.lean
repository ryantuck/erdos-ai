For a permutation $\sigma$ of $\operatorname{Fin}(n)$, the set of distinct consecutive sums.
A consecutive sum is $\sum_{i \in [u,v]} (\sigma(i) + 1)$ for $u \leq v$ in $\operatorname{Fin}(n)$,
corresponding to summing consecutive values of a permutation of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

noncomputable def consecutiveSums (n : ℕ) (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : Finset ℕ :=
  ((Finset.univ (α := Fin n)) ×ˢ (Finset.univ (α := Fin n))).filter (fun p => p.1 ≤ p.2)
    |>.image (fun p => ∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc p.1 p.2, ((σ i).val + 1))

/--
For a permutation $\pi$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, let $S(\pi)$ count the number of distinct
consecutive sums (sums of the form $\sum_{u \leq i \leq v} \pi(i)$).
Is it true that $S(\pi) = o(n^2)$ for all $\pi \in S_n$?

This was disproved by Hegyvári [He86] and shown to be extremely false by
Konieczny [Ko15], who proved that a random permutation has
$\sim \frac{1+e^{-2}}{4} \cdot n^2$ distinct consecutive sums.
