# Erdős Problem 419

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/419](https://www.erdosproblems.com/419)

If $\tau(n)$ counts the number of divisors of $n$, then what is the set of limit
points of $\tau((n+1)!) / \tau(n!)$?

Erdős and Graham [ErGr80] noted that any number of the shape $1 + 1/k$ for $k \geq 1$
is a limit point (and thus so too is $1$), but knew of no others.

Sawhney (and independently Erdős–Graham–Ivić–Pomerance [EGIP96]) proved that
these are the only limit points: the set of limit points of the ratio is
exactly $\{1 + 1/k : k \geq 1\} \cup \{1\}$.

Erdős Problem 419 [ErGr80, p.83] [EGIP96]:

The set of limit points of $\tau((n+1)!) / \tau(n!)$ is exactly
$\{1 + 1/k : k \geq 1\} \cup \{1\}$, where $\tau(n) = |\text{divisors of } n|$.

A value $c$ is a cluster point of this sequence if and only if
$c = 1$ or $c = 1 + 1/k$ for some positive integer $k$.
