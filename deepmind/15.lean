Is it true that the alternating series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n}{p_n}$$
converges, where $p_n$ denotes the $n$-th prime?

This is an open problem. Tao has proved convergence assuming a strong form
of the Hardy–Littlewood prime tuples conjecture.

We state convergence as: the sequence of partial sums
$$S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n}{p_n}$$
converges to a real limit $L$.

Using 0-indexed `Nat.nth Nat.Prime`, the $n$-th term ($n : \mathbb{N}$, 0-indexed) is
$(-1)^{n+1} \cdot (n+1) / p_{n+1}$,
which corresponds to the 1-indexed term $(-1)^{n+1} \cdot (n+1)/p_{n+1}$.
