# Erdős Problem 1156

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1156](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1156)

Let $G$ be a random graph on $n$ vertices, in which every edge is included
independently with probability $1/2$ (the Erdős–Rényi model $G(n, 1/2)$).

Bollobás proved that $\chi(G) \sim n / (2 \log_2 n)$ with high probability.
Shamir and Spencer proved concentration within $o(\sqrt{n})$.
Heckel and Riordan proved concentration cannot be within $n^c$ for $c < 1/2$.

/-- The probability that the chromatic number of a uniformly random graph
$G(n, 1/2)$ on $n$ vertices satisfies predicate $P$. Here $G(n, 1/2)$ is the
Erdős–Rényi model where each edge is included independently with
probability $1/2$, equivalently the uniform distribution over all simple
graphs on $n$ labelled vertices. -/

Erdős Problem 1156, Part 1 [AlSp92]:

There exists a constant $C$ such that $\chi(G(n, 1/2))$ is almost surely concentrated
on at most $C$ values. That is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and all sufficiently large $n$,
there is a set $S$ of at most $C$ natural numbers with
$\mathbb{P}(\chi(G) \in S) \geq 1 - \varepsilon$.

Erdős Problem 1156, Part 2 [AlSp92] [Vu99]:

There exists a function $\omega : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\omega(n) \to \infty$ such that
for every function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$, for all sufficiently large $n$,
$$
\mathbb{P}(|\chi(G) - f(n)| < \omega(n)) < 1/2.
$$
That is, the chromatic number cannot be concentrated in any interval of width
$2\omega(n)$ with probability $\geq 1/2$.
