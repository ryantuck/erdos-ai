Two subgraphs of a graph $G$ are isomorphic if there exists a graph isomorphism

Erdős Problem 426 (Disproved):

We say $H$ is a unique subgraph of $G$ if there is exactly one way to find $H$ as a
subgraph (not necessarily induced) of $G$. Let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of
distinct unique subgraphs in a graph on $n$ vertices.

A problem of Erdős and Entringer [EnEr72], who constructed a graph with
$\gg 2^{\binom{n}{2} - O(n^{3/2+o(1)})}$ many unique subgraphs. This was improved by
Brouwer [Br75], who constructed a graph with $\gg 2^{\binom{n}{2} - O(n)} / n!$ many
unique subgraphs.

Note that there are approximately $2^{\binom{n}{2}} / n!$ non-isomorphic graphs on $n$
vertices, so the bound in the problem statement is trivially best possible.

Erdős believed Brouwer's construction was essentially best possible, but
Spencer suggested that $\gg 2^{\binom{n}{2}} / n!$ might be achievable. Erdős offered
100 dollars for such a construction and 25 dollars for a disproof.

Bradač and Christoph [BrCh24] proved the answer is no:
$$f(n) = o(2^{\binom{n}{2}} / n!).$$
Quantitatively, the $o(1)$ factor can be taken to be $O(\log \log \log n / \log \log n)$.
