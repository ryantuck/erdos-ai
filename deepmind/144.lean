Erdős Problem 144 [Er61, Er77c, Er79, Er79e, ErGr80, Er81h, Er82e, Er85e, Er97c, Er98]:
The density of integers which have two divisors $d_1, d_2$ such that $d_1 < d_2 < 2d_1$
exists and is equal to $1$.

Formally, writing $A(N)$ for the number of integers $n$ with $1 \le n \le N$ which have
two divisors $d_1 < d_2 < 2d_1$, we have $A(N)/N \to 1$ as $N \to \infty$.

Proved by Maier and Tenenbaum [MaTe84].
