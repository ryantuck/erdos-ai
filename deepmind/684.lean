# Erdős Problem 684

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/684](https://www.erdosproblems.com/684)

For $0 \le k \le n$ write $\binom{n}{k} = uv$ where the only primes dividing $u$ are in $[2,k]$
and the only primes dividing $v$ are in $(k,n]$. Let $f(n)$ be the smallest $k$ such
that $u > n^2$. Give bounds for $f(n)$.

Mahler's theorem implies $f(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, but is ineffective and gives
no explicit bounds. Tang proved $f(n) \le n^{30/43 + o(1)}$.
A heuristic suggests $f(n) \sim 2 \log n$ for most $n$.

Erdős Problem 684 [Er79d]: $f(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$.

For every bound $K$, for all sufficiently large $n$, the smallest $k$ such that the
$k$-smooth part of $\binom{n}{k}$ exceeds $n^2$ is greater than $K$.

This follows from Mahler's theorem. The problem asks for effective bounds
on the growth of $f(n)$.
