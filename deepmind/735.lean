# Erdős Problem 735

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/735](https://www.erdosproblems.com/735)

Given any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, when can one assign positive weights to the points
such that the sum of the weights along every line containing at least two points
is the same?

A problem of Murty, who conjectured this is only possible in one of four cases:
1. All points on a line
2. No three points on a line (general position)
3. $n - 1$ points on a line (with one point off)
4. The 7-point incenter configuration: a triangle, the feet of the three angle
   bisectors, and the incenter (or a projective equivalence)

Proved by Ackerman, Buchin, Knauer, Pinchasi, and Rote [ABKPR08].

Erdős Problem 735 (Murty's conjecture, proved by Ackerman–Buchin–Knauer–Pinchasi–Rote [ABKPR08]):

A finite set $S$ of at least 2 points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a balanced weighting if and only if
$S$ is one of:
1. All points collinear,
2. No three points collinear (general position),
3. All but one point collinear, or
4. The 7-point incenter configuration (or a projective equivalence).
