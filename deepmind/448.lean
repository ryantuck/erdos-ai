# Erdős Problem 448

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/448](https://www.erdosproblems.com/448)

Let $\tau(n)$ count the divisors of $n$ and $\tau^+(n)$ count the number of $k$
such that $n$ has a divisor in $[2^k, 2^{k+1})$. Is it true that, for all
$\epsilon > 0$, $\tau^+(n) < \epsilon \tau(n)$ for almost all $n$?

This was disproved by Erdős and Tenenbaum [ErTe81], who showed that for every
$\epsilon > 0$, the upper density of $\{n : \tau^+(n) \geq \epsilon \tau(n)\}$
is $\asymp \epsilon^{1-o(1)}$ (positive for each fixed $\epsilon$).

Hall and Tenenbaum [HaTe88] showed the upper density is
$\ll \epsilon \log(2/\epsilon)$ and proved that $\tau^+(n)/\tau(n)$ has a
distribution function.

/-- Erdős Problem 448 (disproved by Erdős–Tenenbaum [ErTe81]):
For every $\epsilon > 0$, the upper density of $\{n : \tau^+(n) \geq \epsilon \cdot \tau(n)\}$
is positive. This disproves the original conjecture that $\tau^+(n) < \epsilon \cdot \tau(n)$
for almost all $n$. -/
