Erdős Problem #226 [Er57] — SOLVED

Is there an entire non-linear function $f$ such that, for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $x$ is
rational if and only if $f(x)$ is?

Solved by Barth and Schneider [BaSc70], who proved that if $A, B \subset \mathbb{R}$ are
countable dense sets then there exists a transcendental entire function $f$ such that
$f(z) \in B$ if and only if $z \in A$. In [BaSc71] they proved the same result for
countable dense subsets of $\mathbb{C}$.
