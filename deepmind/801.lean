Erdős Problem 801 [Er79g]:

If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with no independent set of size $> \sqrt{n}$,
then there exists a set of $\leq \sqrt{n}$ vertices containing
$\gg \sqrt{n} \log n$ edges.

Formally: there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
for every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, if $G$ has no independent set of size
$> \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$, then there exists a subset $S$ with
$|S| \leq \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ and the number of edges in $G[S]$ is at least
$C \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot \log n$.

Proved by Alon [Al96b].
