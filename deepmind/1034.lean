**Erdős Problem 1034** (Disproved) [Er93, p. 344]:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, does there exist $N_0$ such that for all $n \ge N_0$, every graph on
$n$ vertices with more than $n^2 / 4$ edges contains a triangle $\{u, v, w\}$ such that
more than $(1/2 - \varepsilon) \cdot n$ vertices are each adjacent to at least two of $u$, $v$, $w$?

Disproved by Ma and Tang, who construct a graph with $n$ vertices and
$> n^2 / 4$ edges in which every triangle has at most $(2 - \sqrt{5/2} + o(1))n$
vertices adjacent to at least two of its vertices ($2 - \sqrt{5/2} \approx 0.4189$).
