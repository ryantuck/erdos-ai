Erdős Problem 1089 (Kelly's question, resolved):
Let $g_d(n)$ be minimal such that every collection of $g_d(n)$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ determines
at least $n$ distinct distances. The limit $\lim_{d \to \infty} g_d(n) / d^{n-1}$ exists and
equals $1/(n-1)!$ for all $n \geq 2$.

The lower bound $\binom{d+1}{n-1} + 1 \leq g_d(n)$ is due to Aletheia-Zomlefer [Fe26]
and the upper bound $g_d(n) \leq \binom{d+n-1}{n-1} + 1$ is due to Bannai, Bannai,
and Stanton [BBS83].
