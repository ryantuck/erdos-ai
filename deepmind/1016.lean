# Erdős Problem 1016

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1016](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1016)

Let $h(n)$ be minimal such that there is a graph on $n$ vertices with $n + h(n)$
edges which contains a cycle on $k$ vertices, for all $3 \leq k \leq n$. Such graphs
are called pancyclic. Estimate $h(n)$. In particular, is it true that
$$h(n) \geq \log_2 n + \log^* n - O(1),$$
where $\log^* n$ is the iterated logarithmic function?

A problem of Bondy [Bo71], who claimed a proof (without details) of
$$\log_2(n-1) - 1 \leq h(n) \leq \log_2 n + \log^* n + O(1).$$
Erdős [Er71] believed the upper bound is closer to the truth.

Erdős Problem 1016 [Er71]:

The minimum number of edges beyond $n$ needed for a pancyclic graph on $n$
vertices satisfies $h(n) \geq \lfloor\log_2 n\rfloor + \log^* n - O(1)$.

Formulated as: there exists a constant $C$ such that for all $n \geq 3$,
$h(n) + C \geq \lfloor\log_2 n\rfloor + \log^* n$.
