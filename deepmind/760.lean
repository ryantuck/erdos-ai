# Erdős Problem 760

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/760](https://www.erdosproblems.com/760)

The cochromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\zeta(G)$, is the minimum number of colours
needed to colour the vertices of $G$ such that each colour class induces either
a complete graph or an empty graph.

If $G$ is a graph with chromatic number $\chi(G) = m$ then must $G$ contain a subgraph $H$
with $\zeta(H) \gg m / \log m$?

A problem of Erdős and Gimbel [ErGi93], who proved that there must exist a
subgraph $H$ with $\zeta(H) \gg (m / \log m)^{1/2}$. The proposed bound would be best
possible, as shown by taking $G$ to be a complete graph.

The answer is yes, proved by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov [AKS97].

**Erdős Problem 760** (Proved, Alon–Krivelevich–Sudakov [AKS97]):

There exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for every graph $G$ with sufficiently
large chromatic number $m = \chi(G)$, there exists an induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ with
cochromatic number $\zeta(H) \geq C \cdot m / \log m$.
