Erdős Problem 649 (disproved):

Is it true that for any two primes $p, q$ there exists an integer $n$ such that
$P(n) = p$ and $P(n+1) = q$, where $P(m)$ denotes the greatest prime factor of $m$?

The answer is **no**. There are no solutions to $2^k \equiv -1 \pmod{7}$,
so this fails with $p = 2$ and $q = 7$. [Er95c]
