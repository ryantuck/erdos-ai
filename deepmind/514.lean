noncomputable def maxModulus (f : ℂ → ℂ) (r : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  sSup {x : ℝ | ∃ z : ℂ, ‖z‖ = r ∧ x = ‖f z‖}

/-- Erdős Problem 514 (proved by Boas, unpublished):
For every entire transcendental function $f$, there exists a continuous path $\gamma$
going to infinity such that $|f(\gamma(t))/\gamma(t)^n| \to \infty$ for every $n$. -/

/-- Erdős Problem 514, growth rate variant (open):
For every entire transcendental function $f$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, does there exist a
continuous path $\gamma$ going to infinity along which $|f(z)| \geq M(|z|)^\varepsilon$? -/
