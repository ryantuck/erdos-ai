# Erdős Problem 916

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/916](https://www.erdosproblems.com/916)

Does every graph with $n$ vertices and $2n-2$ edges contain a cycle and another
vertex adjacent to three vertices on the cycle?

This would be a stronger form of Dirac's result [Di60] that every such graph
contains a subgraph homeomorphic to $K_4$.

The answer is yes, as proved by Thomassen [Th74].

Erdős Problem 916 [Er67b]:

Every simple graph with $n$ vertices and at least $2n-2$ edges contains a cycle $C$
and a vertex $v$ not on $C$ that is adjacent to at least three vertices of $C$.

A cycle of length $m$ ($m \geq 3$) is represented as an injective map
`cycle : Fin m → Fin n` where consecutive vertices (including wrap-around)
are adjacent.
