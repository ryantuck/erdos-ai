Erdős Problem 903 [Er82e]:

Let $n = p^2 + p + 1$ for a prime power $p$ (i.e., $p = q^k$ for some prime $q$ and
$k \geq 1$), and let blocks be a pairwise balanced design on $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ (every
pair of distinct elements appears in exactly one block). If the number of
blocks $t > n$, then $t \geq n + p$.

Proved by Erdős, Fowler, Sós, and Wilson [EFSW85].
