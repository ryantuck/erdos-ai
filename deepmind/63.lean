Erdős Problem 63 (Conjectured by Mihók and Erdős [Er93,Er94b,Er95,Er95d,Er96,Er97b]):
Does every graph with infinite chromatic number contain a cycle of length $2^n$ for
infinitely many $n$? Proved by Liu and Montgomery [LiMo20].

Formalized as: for every graph $G$ with infinite chromatic number, for every bound $N$,
there exists $n \geq N$ such that $G$ contains a cycle of length $2^n$.
