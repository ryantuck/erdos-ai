# Erdős Problem 748

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/748](https://www.erdosproblems.com/748)

The Cameron-Erdős Conjecture. Let $f(n)$ count the number of sum-free subsets
$A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$, i.e., $A$ contains no three elements $a$, $b$, $c$ with
$a = b + c$. Is it true that $f(n) = 2^{(1+o(1)) n/2}$?

The lower bound $f(n) \geq 2^{n/2}$ is trivial (consider all subsets of
$\{\lceil n/2 \rceil, \ldots, n\}$).

This was proved independently by Green [Gr04] and Sapozhenko [Sa03], who showed
$f(n) \sim c_n \cdot 2^{n/2}$ where $c_n$ depends on the parity of $n$.

Erdős Problem 748 (Cameron-Erdős Conjecture) [CaEr90][Er94b][Er98]:

Let $f(n)$ count the number of sum-free subsets of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. Then
$$f(n) = 2^{(1+o(1)) n/2}.$$

Equivalently: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $n$,
$$2^{(1 - \varepsilon) \cdot n/2} \leq f(n) \leq 2^{(1 + \varepsilon) \cdot n/2}.$$

Proved independently by Green [Gr04] and Sapozhenko [Sa03].
