/-- Count of natural numbers $n$ in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ with $\varphi(n) < c \cdot n$. -/
noncomputable def totientDensityCount (c : ℝ) (N : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  ((Finset.range (N + 1)).filter (fun n => 0 < n ∧ (Nat.totient n : ℝ) < c * ↑n)).card

Schoenberg proved that for every $c \in [0,1]$ the natural density of
$\{n \in \mathbb{N} : \varphi(n) < cn\}$ exists. Let this density be denoted by $f(c)$.
Is it true that there are no $x$ such that $f'(x)$ exists and is positive?

Erdős proved the distribution function $f$ is purely singular.

theorem erdos_50 :
    ∀ f : ℝ → ℝ,
      (∀ c ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1,
        Tendsto (fun N : ℕ => (totientDensityCount c N : ℝ) / ↑N) atTop (nhds (f c))) →
      ∀ x d : ℝ, HasDerivAt f d x → d ≤ 0 := by
