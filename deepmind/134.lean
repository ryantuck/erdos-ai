# Erdős Problem 134

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/134](https://www.erdosproblems.com/134)

Let $\varepsilon, \delta > 0$ and $n$ be sufficiently large in terms of $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$.
Let $G$ be a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $< n^{1/2 - \varepsilon}$.

Can $G$ be made into a triangle-free graph with diameter $2$ by adding at most $\delta n^2$ edges?

Asked by Erdős and Gyárfás, who proved this is the case when $G$ has maximum degree
$\ll \log n / \log \log n$. A construction of Simonovits shows the conjecture fails if the
maximum degree bound is relaxed to $\leq Cn^{1/2}$ for a large enough constant $C$.

Proved in the affirmative by Alon [Al94]: a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with
maximum degree $< n^{1/2 - \varepsilon}$ can be made into a triangle-free graph with diameter $2$
by adding at most $O(n^{2 - \varepsilon})$ edges.

Erdős Problem 134 [Er97b] (proved by Alon [Al94]):

For every $\varepsilon, \delta > 0$ and all sufficiently large $n$, every triangle-free graph on
$n$ vertices with maximum degree $< n^{1/2 - \varepsilon}$ can be extended to a triangle-free
graph with diameter $\leq 2$ by adding at most $\delta n^2$ edges.

Erdős Problem 134 (Alon's strong form [Al94]):

For every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $C > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
every triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $< n^{1/2 - \varepsilon}$
can be extended to a triangle-free graph with diameter $\leq 2$ by adding at
most $C \cdot n^{2 - \varepsilon}$ edges.
