# Erdős Problem 237

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/237](https://www.erdosproblems.com/237)

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a set such that $|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \gg \log N$ for all large $N$.
Let $f(n)$ count the number of solutions to $n = p + a$ for $p$ prime and $a \in A$.
Is it true that $\limsup f(n) = \infty$?

The answer is yes, as proved by Chen and Ding [ChDi22]. In fact, the
assumption $|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \gg \log N$ can be replaced with just the assumption
that $A$ is infinite. Erdős [Er50] had proved the result when $A = \{2^k : k \geq 0\}$.

Erdős Problem 237 [Er55c, Er61, Er73] (proved by Chen–Ding [ChDi22]):

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \geq c \cdot \log N$ for some $c > 0$ and all
sufficiently large $N$. Let $f(n) = \#\{p \text{ prime} : n - p \in A\}$ count the
representations of $n$ as prime + element of $A$. Then $\limsup f(n) = \infty$,
i.e., for every $M$ there exist arbitrarily large $n$ with $f(n) \geq M$.
