# Erdős Problem 515

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/515](https://www.erdosproblems.com/515)

Let $f(z)$ be an entire function, not a polynomial. Does there exist a locally
rectifiable path $C$ tending to infinity such that, for every $\lambda > 0$, the integral
$\int_C |f(z)|^{-\lambda} \, |dz|$ is finite?

This was proved in the affirmative. The case when $f$ has finite order was proved
by Zhang [Zh77]. The general case was proved by Lewis, Rossi, and Weitsman
[LRW84], who in fact proved this with $|f|$ replaced by $e^u$ where $u$ is any
subharmonic function.

Erdős Problem 515: For any entire function $f$ that is not a polynomial, there
exists a locally rectifiable path $\gamma$ tending to infinity such that for every
$\lambda > 0$, the line integral $\int_\gamma |f(z)|^{-\lambda} \, |dz|$ is finite.

The path $\gamma : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ is parametrized on $[0, \infty)$, is continuous
with locally bounded variation (i.e., locally rectifiable), and satisfies
$\|\gamma(t)\| \to \infty$ as $t \to \infty$. The integral
$\int_\gamma |f(z)|^{-\lambda} \, |dz|$ is expressed as
$\int_0^\infty \|f(\gamma(t))\|^{-\lambda} \cdot \|\gamma'(t)\| \, dt$.

The case when $f$ has finite order was proved by Zhang [Zh77]. The general case
was proved by Lewis, Rossi, and Weitsman [LRW84].
