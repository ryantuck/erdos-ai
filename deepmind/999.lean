Erdős Problem 999 (the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture, now theorem):
For any function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, the property that for almost all
$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, $|\alpha - p/q| < f(q)/q$ has infinitely many solutions with
$\gcd(p,q) = 1$, is equivalent to the divergence of
$\sum \varphi(q) \cdot f(q) / q$.

Proved by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard [KoMa20].
