A finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has no $k$ collinear if every $k$-element subset
is not collinear (i.e., no line contains $k$ or more of the points).

An ordinary line of a point set $P$ is a line (1-dimensional affine subspace)
that contains exactly two points of $P$.

The number of ordinary lines determined by a point set $P$: the number of
lines (1-dimensional affine subspaces) containing exactly two points of $P$.

A subset $A' \subseteq A$ of $r$ points has all its determined lines ordinary with
respect to $A$: for every pair of distinct points $p, q \in A'$, the line through
$p$ and $q$ is ordinary (contains exactly two points of $A$).

$f_{r,k}(n)$: the minimum number of ordinary lines that guarantees the existence
of $r$ points, all of whose $\binom{r}{2}$ determined lines are ordinary.

More precisely, $f_{r,k}(n)$ is the smallest $m$ such that for every set $A$ of $n$
points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no $k$ collinear and at least $m$ ordinary lines, there exists
$A' \subseteq A$ with $|A'| = r$ such that every line determined by $A'$ is ordinary.

Erdős Problem 960 [Er84]:

For fixed $r, k \geq 2$, the threshold $f_{r,k}(n)$ is $o(n^2)$. That is, for every
$\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$,
$f_{r,k}(n) \leq \varepsilon \cdot n^2$.

This is the weaker form of the conjecture. Erdős also asks whether perhaps
$f_{r,k}(n) \ll n$ (i.e., $f_{r,k}(n) = O(n)$).

Erdős Problem 960, stronger form [Er84]:

For fixed $r, k \geq 2$, the threshold $f_{r,k}(n) = O(n)$. That is, there exists
$C > 0$ such that $f_{r,k}(n) \leq C \cdot n$ for all $n$.
