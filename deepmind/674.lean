# Erdős Problem 674

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/674](https://www.erdosproblems.com/674)

Are there any integer solutions to $x^x \cdot y^y = z^z$ with $x, y, z > 1$?

Ko [Ko40] proved there are none if $\gcd(x, y) = 1$, but there are in fact
infinitely many solutions in general — for example,
$x = 2^{12} \cdot 3^6$, $y = 2^8 \cdot 3^8$, $z = 2^{11} \cdot 3^7$.

In [Er79] Erdős asked if the infinite families found by Ko are the only
solutions.
