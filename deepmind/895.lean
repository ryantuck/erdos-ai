Erdős Problem 895 [Er95d]:

Is it true that, for all sufficiently large $n$, if $G$ is a triangle-free graph
on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ then there exist distinct $a, b$ with $a + b$ also in the vertex set
such that $\{a, b, a+b\}$ is an independent set in $G$?

Proved by Barber using a SAT solver: this is true for all $n \geq 18$.

We model the vertex set as $\operatorname{Fin} n = \{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ and require $a \geq 1$,
$b \geq 1$, and $a + b < n$ so that $a$, $b$, $a+b$ are all valid vertices
representing positive integers with $a + b$ in range.
