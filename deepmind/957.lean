# Erdős Problem 957

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/957](https://www.erdosproblems.com/957)

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of size $n$ and let $\{d_1 < \ldots < d_k\}$
be the set of distinct distances determined by $A$. Let $f(d)$ be the number of
(unordered) pairs of points at distance $d$. Is it true that
$$f(d_1) f(d_k) \leq \left(\frac{9}{8} + o(1)\right) n^2?$$

A question of Erdős and Pach [ErPa90]. An unpublished construction of Makai
shows that this would be the best possible. Solved by Dumitrescu [Du19], who
proved $f(d_1) f(d_k) \leq \frac{9}{8} n^2 + O(n)$.

Erdős Problem 957 [ErPa90] (proved by Dumitrescu [Du19]):
For every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large finite point sets
$A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, the product of the frequency of the minimum distance
and the frequency of the maximum distance satisfies
$f(d_{\min}) \cdot f(d_{\max}) \leq (9/8 + \varepsilon) \cdot |A|^2$.
