Erdős Problem 703 (Frankl–Rödl theorem):

Let $r \geq 1$ and define $T(n,r)$ to be the maximum size of a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets
of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that $|A \cap B| \neq r$ for all $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$.

For every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $n$ and $r$ with
$\varepsilon n < r < (1/2 - \varepsilon) n$, we have $T(n,r) < (2 - \delta)^n$.

Proved by Frankl and Rödl [FrRo87].

theorem erdos_703 :
    ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 →
    ∃ δ : ℝ, δ > 0 ∧
      ∀ n : ℕ, ∀ r : ℕ,
        ε * (n : ℝ) < (r : ℝ) →
        (r : ℝ) < (1 / 2 - ε) * (n : ℝ) →
