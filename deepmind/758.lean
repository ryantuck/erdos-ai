# Erdős Problem 758

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/758](https://www.erdosproblems.com/758)

The cochromatic number of $G$, denoted $\zeta(G)$, is the minimum number of colours
needed to colour the vertices of $G$ such that each colour class induces either
a complete graph or an empty graph (independent set). Let $z(n)$ be the maximum
value of $\zeta(G)$ over all graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices.

Erdős Problem 758 [ErGi93]:

Is it true that $z(12) = 4$, where $z(n)$ is the maximum cochromatic number
over all graphs on $n$ vertices?

Resolved: $z(12) = 4$ (confirmed computationally by Bhavik Mehta).
