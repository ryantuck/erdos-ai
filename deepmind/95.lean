The set of distinct distances determined by a finite point set $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

/--
The number of ordered pairs $(p, q)$ from $P$ with $p \neq q$ and $\operatorname{dist}(p, q) = d$.

/--
Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^2$ determine the set of distances $\{u_1, \ldots, u_t\}$.
Suppose $u_i$ appears as the distance between $f(u_i)$ many pairs of points. Then for all
$\varepsilon > 0$,
$$\sum_i f(u_i)^2 \ll_\varepsilon n^{3+\varepsilon}.$$

This was proved by Guth and Katz (2015) who showed the stronger bound
$\sum_i f(u_i)^2 \ll n^3 \log n$.
