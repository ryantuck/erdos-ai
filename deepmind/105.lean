Erdős Problem \#105 (Erdős–Purdy):
Let $A, B \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be disjoint finite sets with $|A| = n$ and $|B| = n - 3$,
with not all of $A$ contained on a single line. The conjecture asks whether
there must exist a line containing at least two points from $A$ and no points
from $B$.

Note: This conjecture has been disproved. Xichuan found three explicit
counterexamples. It remains open whether the result holds with $n - 4$ (or
more generally with $n - O(1)$ or $(1 - o(1))n$ points in $B$).
The condition $n - 2$ is known to fail via a construction of Hickerson.
