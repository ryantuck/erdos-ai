# Erdős Problem 1099

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1099](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1099)

Let $1 = d_1 < \cdots < d_{\tau(n)} = n$ be the divisors of $n$, and for $\alpha > 1$ let
$$h_\alpha(n) = \sum_i \left(\frac{d_{i+1}}{d_i} - 1\right)^\alpha.$$

Is it true that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} h_\alpha(n) \ll_\alpha 1$?

Erdős [Er81h] remarks that $n!$ or $\mathrm{lcm}\{1, \ldots, n\}$ would be good candidates.
The $\liminf$ is trivially $\geq 1$ (considering the term $i = 1$).

Proved by Vose [Vo84] who constructed a specific sequence achieving bounded $h_\alpha(n)$.
It remains open whether $n!$ or $\mathrm{lcm}\{1, \ldots, n\}$ satisfy this property.

This resembles the function $G(n) = \sum_i d_i / d_{i+1}$ considered in problem \#673.

Erdős Problem 1099 (Proved by Vose [Vo84]):

For every $\alpha > 1$, there exists a constant $C$ (depending on $\alpha$) such that
$h_\alpha(n) \leq C$ for infinitely many $n$, i.e., $\liminf_{n \to \infty} h_\alpha(n)$
is finite.

Formally: for every $\alpha > 1$, there exists $C$ such that for every $N$, there
exists $n \geq N$ with $h_\alpha(n) \leq C$.
