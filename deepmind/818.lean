# Erdős Problem 818

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/818](https://www.erdosproblems.com/818)

Let $A$ be a finite set of integers such that $|A+A| \ll |A|$. Is it true that
$$|AA| \gg \frac{|A|^2}{(\log |A|)^C}$$
for some constant $C > 0$?

A problem of Erdős [Er91]. This was proved by Solymosi [So09d], in the strong form
$|AA| \gg |A|^2 / \log |A|$.

**Erdős Problem 818** (proved by Solymosi [So09d]):

There exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for every $K > 0$, there exists $c > 0$
such that for every finite set $A$ of integers with $|A + A| \leq K \cdot |A|$,
we have $|A \cdot A| \geq c \cdot |A|^2 / (\log |A|)^C$.
