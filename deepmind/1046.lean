# Erdős Problem 1046

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1046](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1046)

A problem of Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian [EHP58]. The answer is yes,
proved by Pommerenke [Po59]. Their additional conjecture that the width of
$\{ z : |f(z)| \leq 1 \}$ is always at most $2$ was disproved by Pommerenke.

Erdős Problem 1046 [EHP58, p. 143]:

For any monic polynomial $f \in \mathbb{C}[x]$, if the set
$E = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \|f(z)\| < 1 \}$ is connected, then $E$ is contained in a
closed disc of radius $2$.

Proved by Pommerenke [Po59].
