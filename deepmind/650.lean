/-- The divisibility matching number: given a finite set $A$ of positive integers,
a starting point $t \geq 1$, and a parameter $N$, this is the maximum $r$ such that
there exist $r$ distinct integers $b_1, \ldots, b_r$ in $[t, t + 2N)$ and $r$ distinct
elements $a_1, \ldots, a_r \in A$ with $a_i \mid b_i$. -/

Erdős Problem 650 [Er95c]:

Is it true that $f(m) \ll m^{1/2}$? Erdős and Sarányi [ErSa59] proved $f(m) \gg m^{1/2}$,
so this would establish $f(m) \asymp m^{1/2}$.
