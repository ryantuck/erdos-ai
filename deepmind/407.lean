# Erdős Problem 407

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/407](https://www.erdosproblems.com/407)

Let $w(n)$ count the number of solutions to $n = 2^a + 3^b + 2^c \cdot 3^d$ with
$a, b, c, d \geq 0$ integers. Is it true that $w(n)$ is bounded by some absolute
constant?

A conjecture originally due to Newman. This was proved by Evertse, Györy,
Stewart, and Tijdeman [EGST88]. Bajpai and Bennett [BaBe24] showed that
$w(n) \leq 4$ for $n \geq 131082$ and $w(n) \leq 9$ for all $n$.

Erdős Problem 407 [ErGr80, p.80]:

There exists an absolute constant $C$ such that for every natural number $n$,
the number of 4-tuples $(a, b, c, d)$ of natural numbers satisfying
$n = 2^a + 3^b + 2^c \cdot 3^d$ is at most $C$.
