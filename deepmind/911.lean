/-- The size Ramsey number $\hat{R}(G)$: the minimum number of edges in a graph $H$
    that is Ramsey for $G$.

    A graph $H$ on $N$ vertices is Ramsey for $G$ if every 2-coloring of the edges
    of $H$ (represented as a symmetric function $c : \operatorname{Fin} N \to
    \operatorname{Fin} N \to \operatorname{Bool}$) contains a monochromatic copy of
    $G$, i.e., an injective map $f$ from the vertices of $G$ into
    $\operatorname{Fin} N$ that preserves adjacency in $H$ and maps all edges to the
    same color. -/

Erdős Problem #911 [Er82e, p.78]:

Is there a function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $f(x)/x \to \infty$ as
$x \to \infty$ such that, for all sufficiently large $C$, if $G$ is any graph with
$n$ vertices and at least $C \cdot n$ edges then
$\hat{R}(G) > f(C) \cdot |E(G)|$?
