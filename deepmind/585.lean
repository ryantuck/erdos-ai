# Erdős Problem 585

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/585](https://www.erdosproblems.com/585)

What is the maximum number of edges that a graph on $n$ vertices can have if it
does not contain two edge-disjoint cycles with the same vertex set?

A problem of Erdős [Er76b].

Pyber, Rödl, and Szemerédi [PRS95] constructed such a graph with
$\gg n \log \log n$ edges (lower bound).

Chakraborti, Janzer, Methuku, and Montgomery [CJMM24] showed that such a
graph can have at most $n \cdot (\log n)^{O(1)}$ many edges (upper bound).

Erdős Problem 585, Lower Bound [PRS95]:

There exists a constant $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph with no two edge-disjoint
cycles on the same vertex set is at least $c \cdot n \cdot \log(\log(n))$.
