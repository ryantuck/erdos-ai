/--
Count of pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \le j \le k$, $0 \le i \le j$, and $a(i) + a(j) \le n$.
Used in the recursive definition of the Rosen sequence.

/--
Total count of pairs $(i,j)$ with $i \le j$, $j \ge 1$, from the full infinite
sequence, such that $a(i) + a(j) \le x$. For a strictly increasing sequence
on $\mathbb{N}$, $a(j) \ge j$, so restricting $j \le x$ suffices.

/--
The Rosen sequence property: $a(0) = 0$, the sequence is strictly increasing,
and each $a(k+1)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that the pair count with
respect to the first $k+1$ terms is strictly less than $n$.

Erdős Problem 954 [Er77c, p.71]:

Let $0 = a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ be the sequence defined by $a_0 = 0$ and $a_{k+1}$ is
the smallest integer $n$ for which the number of pairs $(i,j)$ with
$0 \le i \le j \le k$, $j \ge 1$, and $a_i + a_j \le n$ is strictly less than $n$.

The sequence begins $0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, \ldots$ (OEIS A390642).

Is the total pair count $R(x) = \#\{(i,j) : i \le j,\, j \ge 1,\, a_i + a_j \le x\}$
equal to $x + O(x^{1/4 + o(1)})$?

By construction $R(x) \ge x$ always. Erdős and Rosen could not even prove
whether $R(x) \le (1 + o(1))x$.
