Erdős Problem #485 (Erdős–Rényi conjecture, proved by Schinzel [Sc87]):

Let $f(k)$ be the minimum number of nonzero terms in $P(x)^2$, where $P \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$
ranges over all polynomials with exactly $k$ nonzero terms. Is it true that
$f(k) \to \infty$ as $k \to \infty$?

Schinzel proved $f(k) > \log(\log k) / \log 2$. Schinzel and Zannier [ScZa09]
improved this to $f(k) \gg \log k$.
