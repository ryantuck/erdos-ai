# Erdős Problem 736

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/736](https://www.erdosproblems.com/736)

A conjecture of Walter Taylor. Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$.
Is there, for every cardinal number $m$, some graph $G_m$ of chromatic number $m$
such that every finite subgraph of $G_m$ is a subgraph of $G$?

Komjáth and Shelah [KoSh05] proved that it is consistent that the answer is no,
so the conjecture is not provable in ZFC.

graphs_. J. Graph Theory 49 (2005), 28-38.

Erdős Problem 736 [Er81] [Er93, p. 343]:

If $G$ is a graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$, then for every cardinal $m$,
there exists a graph $G_m$ with chromatic number $m$ such that every finite
subgraph of $G_m$ is also a subgraph of $G$.

A conjecture of Walter Taylor. Komjáth and Shelah [KoSh05] proved that
this is consistently false (not provable in ZFC).
