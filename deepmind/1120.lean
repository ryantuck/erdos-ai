Erdős Problem 1120 [Ha74, Problem 4.22]:

Let $f \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ be a monic polynomial of degree $n$, all of whose roots satisfy
$|z| \leq 1$. Let $E = \{z : |f(z)| \leq 1\}$. The worst-case shortest length of a path in $E$
joining $z = 0$ to $|z| = 1$ tends to infinity with $n$.

Erdős wrote "presumably this tends to infinity with $n$, but not too fast."
The trivial lower bound is $1$ (achieved by $f(z) = z^n$). Clunie and Netanyahu
showed that a path always exists joining $z = 0$ to $|z| = 1$ in $E$.

Formally: for every $C > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, there exists a
monic polynomial $f$ of degree $n$ with all roots in the closed unit disk, such that
every continuous path $\gamma : [0,1] \to E$ from $0$ to the unit circle has arc length $\geq C$.
