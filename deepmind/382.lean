Erdős Problem 382 (Part 1) [ErGr80]:

Let $u \le v$ be such that the largest prime dividing $\prod_{u \le m \le v} m$ appears with
exponent at least $2$. Is it true that $v - u = v^{o(1)}$?

This means: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $v$, if the interval $[u,v]$
has its largest prime factor appearing with exponent $\ge 2$, then $v - u \le v^{\varepsilon}$.

Erdős Problem 382 (Part 2) [ErGr80]:

Can $v - u$ be arbitrarily large? That is, for every $k$, do there exist $u \le v$
with $v - u \ge k$ such that the largest prime dividing $\prod_{u \le m \le v} m$ appears
with exponent at least $2$?
