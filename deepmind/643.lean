# Erdős Problem 643

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/643](https://www.erdosproblems.com/643)

Let $f(n;t)$ be minimal such that if a $t$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices
contains at least $f(n;t)$ edges then there must be four edges $A,B,C,D$ such
that $A \cup B = C \cup D$ and $A \cap B = C \cap D = \emptyset$.

Estimate $f(n;t)$ — in particular, is it true that for $t \geq 3$,
$f(n;t) = (1+o(1))\binom{n}{t-1}$?

For $t=2$ this asks for the maximum number of edges in a graph with no $C_4$,
giving $f(n;2) = (1/2+o(1))n^{3/2}$.

Füredi [Fu84] proved $f(n;3) \ll n^2$ and $f(n;3) > \binom{n}{2}$ for
infinitely many $n$. Pikhurko and Verstraëte [PiVe09] proved
$f(n;3) \leq \frac{13}{9}\binom{n}{2}$ for all $n$.

More generally, Füredi proved
$\binom{n-1}{t-1} + \lfloor(n-1)/t\rfloor \leq f(n;t) < \frac{7}{2}\binom{n}{t-1}$,
and conjectured the lower bound is sharp for $t \geq 4$.

Pikhurko and Verstraëte proved
$1 \leq \limsup_{n\to\infty} f(n;t)/\binom{n}{t-1} \leq \min(7/4, 1+2/\sqrt{t})$
for all $t \geq 3$.

**Erdős Problem 643** [Er77b][Er97d]:

For every $t \geq 3$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that
for all $n \geq N$, every $t$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with more than
$(1+\varepsilon)\binom{n}{t-1}$ edges contains the complementary pairs
configuration, and there exists one with at least
$(1-\varepsilon)\binom{n}{t-1}$ edges avoiding it.

Equivalently, $f(n;t) = (1+o(1))\binom{n}{t-1}$ for all $t \geq 3$.
