**Erdős–Sós Conjecture.** Let $k \geq 4$. If $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of $k$-element subsets of
$\{1, \ldots, n\}$ with $|\mathcal{F}| > \binom{n-2}{k-2}$, then there exist distinct
$A, B \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $|A \cap B| = 1$.

Proved by Katona (unpublished) for $k = 4$, and by Frankl [Fr77] for all $k \geq 4$.
