# Erdős Problem 280

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/280](https://www.erdosproblems.com/280)

Let $n_1 < n_2 < \cdots$ be an infinite sequence of integers with associated residue
classes $a_k \pmod{n_k}$, such that for some $\varepsilon > 0$ we have
$n_k > (1+\varepsilon)k \log k$ for all $k \geq 1$. Erdős and Graham conjectured that
$$\#\{m < n_k : m \not\equiv a_i \pmod{n_i} \text{ for } 1 \leq i \leq k\} \neq o(k).$$

This was disproved by Cambie, who observed that taking $n_k = 2^k$ and
$a_k = 2^{k-1} + 1$ for $k \geq 1$ gives a trivial counterexample: the only $m$
not in any congruence class is $1$, so the count is $1$ for all $k$.

Erdős Problem 280 (Disproved) [ErGr80, p.29]:

There exist a strictly increasing sequence $n_1 < n_2 < \cdots$ of positive integers
and associated residue classes $a_k \pmod{n_k}$, with $n_k > (1+\varepsilon)k \log k$
for some $\varepsilon > 0$ and all $k \geq 1$, such that the sieve count
$$\#\{m < n_k : m \not\equiv a_i \pmod{n_i} \text{ for } 1 \leq i \leq k\}$$
is $o(k)$ as $k \to \infty$.
