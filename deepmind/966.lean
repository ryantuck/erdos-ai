# Erdős Problem 966

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/966](https://www.erdosproblems.com/966)

Let $k, r \geq 2$. Does there exist a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ that contains no non-trivial
arithmetic progression of length $k + 1$, yet in any $r$-colouring of $A$ there
must exist a monochromatic non-trivial arithmetic progression of length $k$?

A problem of Erdős [Er75b]. Spencer has shown that such a set exists.
This is an arithmetic analogue of the graph theory version [924].

Erdős Problem 966 [Er75b]:

For all $k \geq 2$ and $r \geq 2$, there exists a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ that contains no
$(k+1)$-term arithmetic progression, yet every $r$-colouring of $A$ contains
a monochromatic $k$-term arithmetic progression.

Proved by Spencer.
