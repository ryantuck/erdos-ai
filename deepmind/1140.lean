Erdős Problem #1140 [Va99, 1.5] (Disproved):

Do there exist infinitely many $n$ such that $n - 2x^2$ is prime for all $x$
with $2x^2 < n$?

The known such $n$ are $2, 5, 7, 13, 31, 61, 181, 199$. Epure and Gica [EpGi10]
proved that the only such $n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ are $5, 13, 61, 181$, and the only
such $n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ are $7, 31, 199$ (with at most one exception).
This implies that, with at most one exception, the list above is complete.
