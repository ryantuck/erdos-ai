Erdős Problem 794 (DISPROVED by Harris):

Is it true that every 3-uniform hypergraph on $3n$ vertices with at least $n^3 + 1$
edges must contain either a subgraph on 4 vertices with 3 edges or a subgraph on
5 vertices with 7 edges?

Balogh observed that every 3-uniform hypergraph on 5 vertices with 7
edges contains a sub-hypergraph on 4 vertices with 3 edges, so the second
condition is redundant. Harris provided a counterexample to the remaining
statement: the 3-uniform hypergraph on $\{1, \ldots, 9\}$ with 28 edges, formed by taking
27 edges by choosing one element each from $\{1,2,3\}$, $\{4,5,6\}$, $\{7,8,9\}$, and then
adding the edge $\{1,2,3\}$.
