# Erdős Problem 739

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/739](https://www.erdosproblems.com/739)

If a graph has infinite chromatic number $\mathfrak{m}$, must every infinite cardinal
$\mathfrak{n} < \mathfrak{m}$ be realized as the chromatic number of some subgraph?

A question of Galvin [Ga73], who proved the case $\mathfrak{m} = \aleph_0$.
Komjáth [Ko88b] proved it is consistent that the answer is no
(with $\mathfrak{m} = \aleph_2$ and $\mathfrak{n} = \aleph_1$).
Shelah [Sh90] proved that assuming $V = L$, the answer is yes
with $\mathfrak{m} = \aleph_2$ and $\mathfrak{n} = \aleph_1$.

Erdős Problem 739 [Er81]:

If $G$ is a graph with infinite chromatic number $\mathfrak{m}$, then for every infinite
cardinal $\mathfrak{n} < \mathfrak{m}$, there is a subgraph of $G$ with chromatic
number $\mathfrak{n}$.

A question of Galvin [Ga73], who proved the case $\mathfrak{m} = \aleph_0$. This is not provable
in ZFC: Komjáth [Ko88b] showed it is consistent that the answer is no.
