# Erdős Problem 984

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/984](https://www.erdosproblems.com/984)

Can $\mathbb{N}$ be 2-coloured such that if $\{a, a+d, \ldots, a+(k-1)d\}$ is a $k$-term
monochromatic arithmetic progression then $k \ll_\varepsilon a^\varepsilon$ for all
$\varepsilon > 0$?

A question of Spencer, who proved that this is possible with 3 colours,
with $a^\varepsilon$ replaced by a very slowly growing function $h(a)$ (the inverse of
the van der Waerden function). Erdős reports that he can construct such a
colouring with the bound $k \ll a^{1-c}$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$.

Zach Hunter proved that the answer is yes.

Erdős Problem 984 [Er80]:

There exists a 2-colouring of $\mathbb{N}$ such that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there is a
constant $C > 0$ such that every $k$-term monochromatic arithmetic progression
$\{a, a+d, \ldots, a+(k-1)d\}$ with $a \ge 1$ satisfies $k \le C \cdot a^\varepsilon$.
