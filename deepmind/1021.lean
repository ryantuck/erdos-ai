# Erdős Problem 1021

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1021](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1021)

Is it true that, for every $k \ge 3$, there is a constant $c_k > 0$ such that
$$\mathrm{ex}(n, G_k) \ll n^{3/2 - c_k},$$
where $G_k$ is the 1-subdivision of $K_k$: the bipartite graph between
$\{y_1, \ldots, y_k\}$ and $\{z_1, \ldots, z_{\binom{k}{2}}\}$, with each $z_j$ joined to a
unique pair of $y_i$?

A conjecture of Erdős and Simonovits [Er71, p.103][Er74c, p.79]. This was
proved by Conlon and Lee [CoLe21] with $c_k = 6^{-k}$, later improved to
$c_k = 1/(4k-6)$ by Janzer [Ja19].

Erdős Problem 1021 [Er71, p.103][Er74c, p.79]:

For every $k \ge 3$, there exists $c_k > 0$ and $C > 0$ such that every $n$-vertex
graph not containing the 1-subdivision of $K_k$ as a subgraph has at most
$C \cdot n^{3/2 - c_k}$ edges.

Proved by Conlon and Lee [CoLe21] with $c_k = 6^{-k}$. Improved to
$c_k = 1/(4k-6)$ by Janzer [Ja19].
