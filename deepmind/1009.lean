# Erdős Problem 1009

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1009](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1009)

Is it true that, for every $c > 0$, there exists $f(c)$ such that every graph on $n$
vertices with at least $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor + k$ edges, where $k < cn$, contains at least
$k - f(c)$ many edge-disjoint triangles?

Erdős proved this for $c < 1/2$. Sauer showed $f(2) \geq 1$. This was proved in
general by Györi [Gy88] who showed $f(c) \ll c^2$, and also that $f(c) = 0$ if
$c < 2$ for odd $n$ or $c < 3/2$ for even $n$.
