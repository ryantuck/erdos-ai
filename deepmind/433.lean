# Erdős Problem 433

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/433](https://www.erdosproblems.com/433)

If $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ is a finite set with $\gcd(A) = 1$, let $G(A)$ denote the Frobenius
number: the greatest natural number not expressible as a non-negative integer linear combination of
elements of $A$ (with repetitions allowed). Define
$$g(k,n) = \max G(A)$$
where the maximum is over all $A \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $|A| = k$ and $\gcd(A) = 1$.

Is it true that $g(k,n) \sim n^2/(k-1)$?

This was proved by Dixmier [Di90], who showed that for all $2 \leq k < n$,
$$\lfloor(n-2)/(k-1)\rfloor(n-k+1) - 1 \leq g(k,n) \leq (\lfloor(n-1)/(k-1)\rfloor - 1)n - 1.$$
