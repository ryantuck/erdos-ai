# Erdős Problem 551

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/551](https://www.erdosproblems.com/551)

Prove that $R(C_k, K_n) = (k-1)(n-1) + 1$ for $k \geq n \geq 3$ (except when $n = k = 3$).

Here $R(C_k, K_n)$ is the off-diagonal Ramsey number, $C_k$ is the cycle graph on
$k$ vertices, and $K_n$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices.

Asked by Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp [EFRS78]. This identity was
proved for $k > n^2 - 2$ by Bondy and Erdős [BoEr73], extended to $k \geq 4n + 2$ by
Nikiforov [Ni05], and established for sufficiently large $n$ by Keevash, Long,
and Skokan [KLS21].

Erdős Problem 551 [EFRS78]:

Prove that $R(C_k, K_n) = (k - 1)(n - 1) + 1$ for $k \geq n \geq 3$, except when $n = k = 3$.

Here $C_k$ is the cycle graph on $k$ vertices and $K_n$ is the complete graph on $n$
vertices (expressed as $\top : \text{SimpleGraph}(\text{Fin}\; n)$).
