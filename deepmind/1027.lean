# Erdős Problem 1027

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1027](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1027)

Let $c > 0$, and let $n$ be sufficiently large depending on $c$. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is a
family of at most $c \cdot 2^n$ many finite sets of size $n$. Let
$X = \bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{F}} A$.

Must there exist $\gg_c 2^{|X|}$ many sets $B \subset X$ which intersect every set in
$\mathcal{F}$, yet contain none of them?

This was proved in the affirmative by Koishi Chan.

Erdős Problem 1027:
For every $c > 0$, there exist $\delta > 0$ and $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$,
for any family $\mathcal{F}$ of finite sets each of size $n$ with
$|\mathcal{F}| \leq c \cdot 2^n$, letting $X = \bigcup \mathcal{F}$, the number of subsets
$B$ of $X$ that intersect every member of $\mathcal{F}$ but contain none of them is at least
$\delta \cdot 2^{|X|}$.
