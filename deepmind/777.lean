# Erdős Problem 777

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/777](https://www.erdosproblems.com/777)

Three questions of Daykin and Erdős on comparability graphs of families of subsets.

The first question was answered affirmatively by Alon, Das, Glebov, and Sudakov.
The second question was answered negatively by Alon and Frankl.
The third question was answered affirmatively by Alon and Frankl.

The number of edges of the comparability graph of a family $F$ of subsets of
$\mathrm{Fin}(n)$: the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ in $F \times F$ with $A \neq B$ and
$A \subseteq B$. Each unordered comparable pair $\{A, B\}$ is counted exactly once
(the one with $A \subsetneq B$).

**Erdős Problem 777, Question 1** (solved, affirmative — Alon–Das–Glebov–Sudakov):

For all $\varepsilon > 0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large and $F$ is a family of at most
$\lfloor (2 - \varepsilon) \cdot 2^{n/2} \rfloor$ subsets of $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$, then the
comparability graph of $F$ has fewer than $2^n$ edges.

**Erdős Problem 777, Question 2** (solved, negative — Alon–Frankl):

The answer to Question 2 is no. There exists $c > 0$ such that for all $C > 0$,
for sufficiently large $n$, there is a family $F$ of subsets of $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ with
$|F| > C \cdot 2^{n/2}$ and at least $c \cdot |F|^2$ comparable pairs.

**Erdős Problem 777, Question 3** (solved, affirmative — Alon–Frankl):

For all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $n$ and every family $F$ of
subsets of $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$, if the number of comparable pairs exceeds $|F|^{2 - \delta}$,
then $|F| < (2 + \varepsilon)^{n/2}$.
