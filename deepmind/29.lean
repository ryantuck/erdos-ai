The additive representation function $r_A(n) = (1_A * 1_A)(n)$ counts the number of ordered
pairs $(a, b)$ with $a, b \in A$ and $a + b = n$. This is the Dirichlet convolution of the
indicator function $1_A$ with itself, evaluated at $n$.

There exists a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that:
1. $A$ is an additive basis of order 2: every natural number is a sum of two elements of $A$
   (i.e., $A + A = \mathbb{N}$), and
2. The additive representation function $r_A(n) = (1_A * 1_A)(n)$ grows sub-polynomially:
   $r_A(n) = o(n^\varepsilon)$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$.

The existence of such a set was first proved by Erdős using probabilistic methods
(answering a question of Sidon from 1932). An explicit construction was given by
Jain, Pham, Sawhney, and Zakharov (2024).
