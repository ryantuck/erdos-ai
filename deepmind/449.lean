# Erdős Problem 449

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/449](https://www.erdosproblems.com/449)

Let $r(n)$ count the number of pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ such that $d_1 \mid n$ and
$d_2 \mid n$ and $d_1 < d_2 < 2d_1$. Is it true that, for every $\epsilon > 0$,
$r(n) < \epsilon \tau(n)$ for almost all $n$, where $\tau(n)$ is the number of
divisors of $n$?

This is false. For any constant $K > 0$, we have $r(n) > K\tau(n)$ for a
positive density set of $n$. Kevin Ford observed this follows from the negative
solution to [448] via the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

/-- Erdős Problem 449 (DISPROVED by Ford, via the negative solution to [448]):

For every $K > 0$, the upper density of $\{n : r(n) \geq K \cdot \tau(n)\}$ is positive.
This disproves the original conjecture that $r(n) < \epsilon \cdot \tau(n)$ for almost all $n$. -/
