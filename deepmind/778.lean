# Erdős Problem 778

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/778](https://www.erdosproblems.com/778)

Alice and Bob play a game on the edges of $K_n$, alternating colouring edges
by red (Alice) and blue (Bob). Alice goes first, and wins if at the end
the largest red clique is larger than any of the blue cliques.

Malekshahian and Spiro [MaSp24] proved that for the first game, the set of $n$
for which Bob wins has density at least $3/4$.

Erdős Problem 778, Part 1 [Gu83]:

Does Bob have a winning strategy in the standard edge-coloring game on $K_n$
(alternating, Alice first) for all $n \geq 3$? That is, can he ensure his largest
blue clique is at least as large as Alice's largest red clique?

Erdős Problem 778, Part 2 [Gu83]:

In the modified game on $K_n$ where Alice colors one edge (red) and Bob colors two edges
(blue) per round, does Bob have a winning strategy for all $n > 3$? That is, can he ensure his
largest blue clique is strictly larger than Alice's largest red clique?
