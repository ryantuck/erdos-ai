# Erdős Problem 185

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/185](https://www.erdosproblems.com/185)

Let $f_3(n)$ be the maximal size of a subset of $\{0,1,2\}^n$ which contains no three
points on a line. Is it true that $f_3(n) = o(3^n)$?

Originally considered by Moser. It is trivial that $f_3(n) \ge R_3(3^n)$, the maximal
size of a subset of $\{1,\ldots,3^n\}$ without a three-term arithmetic progression.
Moser showed that $f_3(n) \gg 3^n / \sqrt{n}$. The answer is yes, which is a corollary of
the density Hales-Jewett theorem, proved by Furstenberg and Katznelson [FuKa91].

/-- A combinatorial line in $\{0,1,2\}^n$ consists of three points parameterized by
$j \in \{0,1,2\}$, such that there exists a nonempty set $S$ of "active" coordinates
where the $j$-th point has value $j$ at each active coordinate, and all three points
agree at non-active coordinates. -/

Erdős Problem 185 (Density Hales-Jewett for $k=3$) [Er73]:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \ge N$, every subset
$A \subseteq \{0,1,2\}^n$ of size $|A| > \varepsilon \cdot 3^n$ contains a combinatorial
line (three points on a line).

Equivalently, the maximum size $f_3(n)$ of a line-free subset of $\{0,1,2\}^n$ satisfies
$f_3(n) = o(3^n)$.
