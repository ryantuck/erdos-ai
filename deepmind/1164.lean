Erdős Problem 1164 (Erdős–Taylor) [Va99, 6.76]:

Let $R_n$ be the maximal integer such that almost every random walk from the origin
in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ visits every $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ with $\|x\| \le R_n$ in at most $n$ steps.
Is it true that $\log R_n \asymp \sqrt{\log n}$?

That is, there exist constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$ such that almost surely, for all
sufficiently large $n$:
$$c_1 \cdot \sqrt{\log n} \le \log R_n \le c_2 \cdot \sqrt{\log n}.$$

Proved independently by Révész [Re90] and Kesten. The stronger conjecture
$$\lim P((\log R_n)^2 / \log n \le x) = e^{-4x} \quad \text{for all } x > 0$$
was proved by Dembo, Peres, Rosen, and Zeitouni [DPRZ04].
