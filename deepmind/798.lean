# Erdős Problem 798

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/798](https://www.erdosproblems.com/798)

Let $t(n)$ be the minimum number of points in $\{1, \ldots, n\}^2$ such that the $\binom{t}{2}$
lines determined by these points cover all points in $\{1, \ldots, n\}^2$.

Estimate $t(n)$. In particular, is it true that $t(n) = o(n)$?

A problem of Erdős and Purdy, who proved $t(n) \gg n^{2/3}$.
Resolved by Alon [Al91] who proved $t(n) \ll n^{2/3} \log n$, confirming $t(n) = o(n)$.

Erdős Problem 798 (proved by Alon [Al91]):

$t(n) = o(n)$, i.e., the minimum number of points in $\{1, \ldots, n\}^2$ whose lines
cover all grid points is sublinear in $n$.

Equivalently: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$,
$t(n) \leq \varepsilon \cdot n$.
