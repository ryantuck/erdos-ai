# Erdős Problem 1110

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1110](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1110)

Let $p > q \geq 2$ be two coprime integers. We call $n$ *representable* if it is the sum of
integers of the form $p^k q^l$, none of which divide each other.

If $\{p,q\} \neq \{2,3\}$ then what can be said about the density of non-representable numbers?
Are there infinitely many coprime non-representable numbers?

[ErLe96] Erdős, P. and Lewin, M., proved that there are finitely many non-representable numbers
if and only if $\{p,q\} = \{2,3\}$.

[YuCh22] Yu and Chen proved that the set of representable numbers has density zero for
many cases, and that there are infinitely many coprime non-representable numbers for
most parameter choices. Some cases remain open.

Erdős Problem 1110 [ErLe96]:

For coprime integers $p > q \geq 2$ with $\{p,q\} \neq \{2,3\}$, there are infinitely many
non-representable numbers that are coprime to $p \cdot q$.

Since $p > q \geq 2$ and $p, q$ are coprime, the only excluded case is $p = 3, q = 2$.
