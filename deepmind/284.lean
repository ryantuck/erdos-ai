# Erdős Problem 284

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/284](https://www.erdosproblems.com/284)

Let $f(k)$ be the maximal value of $n_1$ such that there exist $n_1 < n_2 < \cdots < n_k$
with $1 = 1/n_1 + \cdots + 1/n_k$. Is it true that $f(k) = (1+o(1)) \, k/(e-1)$?

The upper bound $f(k) \leq (1+o(1)) \, k/(e-1)$ is trivial since for any $u \geq 1$ we have
$\sum_{u \leq n \leq eu} 1/n = 1 + o(1)$, and hence if $f(k) = u$ then $k \geq (e-1-o(1))u$.

Essentially solved by Croot [Cr01], who showed that for any $N > 1$ there exists
some $k \geq 1$ and $N < n_1 < \cdots < n_k \leq (e+o(1))N$ with $1 = \sum 1/n_i$.

Erdős Problem 284 (Proved) [ErGr80]:

$f(k) = (1+o(1)) \, k/(e-1)$, where $f(k)$ is the maximal minimum element in any
representation of $1$ as a sum of $k$ distinct unit fractions.

Equivalently, $f(k) \cdot (e-1) / k \to 1$ as $k \to \infty$.
