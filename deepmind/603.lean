# Erdős Problem 603

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/603](https://www.erdosproblems.com/603)

A problem of Komjáth [Er87]. Let $(A_i)$ be a family of countably infinite sets such that
$|A_i \cap A_j| \neq 2$ for all $i \neq j$. Find the smallest cardinal $C$ such that
$\bigcup A_i$ can always be coloured with at most $C$ colours so that no $A_i$ is
monochromatic. If instead we have $|A_i \cap A_j| \neq 1$ then Komjáth showed that this is
possible with at most $\aleph_0$ colours.

Erdős Problem 603 [Er87]:

Let $(A_i)$ be a family of countably infinite sets such that $|A_i \cap A_j| \neq 2$
for all $i \neq j$. Then there is a colouring with at most $\aleph_0$ colours so that
no $A_i$ is monochromatic.

This is conjectured by analogy with the Komjáth result for the $|A_i \cap A_j| \neq 1$
case, where $\aleph_0$ colours suffice.
