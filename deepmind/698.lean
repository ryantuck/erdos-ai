# Erdős Problem 698

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/698](https://www.erdosproblems.com/698)

A problem of Erdős and Szekeres [ErSz78], who observed that
$$\gcd\left(\binom{n}{i}, \binom{n}{j}\right) \geq \frac{\binom{n}{i}}{\binom{j}{i}} \geq 2^i$$
(in particular the greatest common divisor is always $> 1$). This inequality is
sharp for $i = 1$, $j = p$, and $n = 2p$.

Resolved by Bergman [Be11], who proved that for any $2 \leq i < j \leq n/2$,
$$\gcd\left(\binom{n}{i}, \binom{n}{j}\right) \gg n^{1/2} \cdot 2^i / i^{3/2},$$
where the implied constant is absolute.

Erdős Problem 698 [ErSz78] — proved by Bergman [Be11]:
There exists $h : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $h(n) \to \infty$ such that for all
$2 \leq i < j \leq n/2$,
$$\gcd\left(\binom{n}{i}, \binom{n}{j}\right) \geq h(n).$$
