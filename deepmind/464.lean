A sequence $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is lacunary if it is strictly increasing and there
exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $a(k+1) \geq (1+\varepsilon) \cdot a(k)$ for all $k$.

Erdős Problem 464 (Proved by de Mathan and Pollington):

Let $A = \{n_1 < n_2 < \cdots\} \subset \mathbb{N}$ be a lacunary sequence (there exists
$\varepsilon > 0$ with $n_{k+1} \geq (1+\varepsilon)n_k$ for all $k$). Then there exists an
irrational $\theta$ such that $\{\| \theta n_k \| : k \geq 1\}$ is not dense in $[0, 1/2]$,
where $\|x\|$ denotes the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.

The "not dense" condition is formalized as: there exist $0 \leq c < d \leq 1/2$ such that
$\|\theta n_k\| \notin (c, d)$ for all $k$, i.e., the image avoids some open subinterval
of $[0, 1/2]$.
