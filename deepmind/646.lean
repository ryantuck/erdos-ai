# Erdős Problem 646

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/646](https://www.erdosproblems.com/646)

Let $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ be distinct primes. Are there infinitely many $n$ such that
$n!$ is divisible by an even power of each of the $p_i$?

The answer is yes, proved by Berend [Be97], who further proved that the
sequence of such $n$ has bounded gaps (where the bound depends on the initial
set of primes).

Erdős Problem 646 (proved by Berend [Be97]):

For any finite set of primes, there are infinitely many $n$ such that
$n!$ is divisible by an even power of each prime in the set. Equivalently,
for each prime $p$ in the set, the $p$-adic valuation of $n!$ is even.
