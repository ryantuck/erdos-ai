Erdős Problem 491 (proved by Wirsing [Wi70]):

Let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ be an additive function (i.e. $f(ab) = f(a) + f(b)$ whenever
$\gcd(a,b) = 1$). If there is a constant $c$ such that $|f(n+1) - f(n)| < c$ for
all $n$, then there exist constants $c'$ and $M$ such that $|f(n) - c' \log n| \leq M$
for all $n \geq 1$.
