# Erdős Problem 466

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/466](https://www.erdosproblems.com/466)

Let $N(X, \delta)$ denote the maximum number of points $P_1, \ldots, P_n$ which can be chosen
in a disk of radius $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\| |P_i - P_j| \| \geq \delta$ for all
$1 \leq i < j \leq n$, where $\|x\|$ denotes the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.

This was proved by Graham, who showed $N(X, 1/10) > (\log X)/10$.

Erdős Problem 466 (Proved by Graham):

There exists $\delta > 0$ such that $N(X, \delta) \to \infty$ as $X \to \infty$. Formalized as:
there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for every $M$, for sufficiently large $X$,
one can find at least $M$ points in a disk of radius $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ whose
pairwise distances all satisfy $\|d\| \geq \delta$.
