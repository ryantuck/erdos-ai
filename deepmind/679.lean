Erdős Problem 679, Part 1 [Er79d]:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, are there infinitely many $n$ such that for all sufficiently
large $k$ (with $1 \leq k < n$), we have
$\omega(n - k) < (1 + \varepsilon) \cdot \log k / \log \log k$?

Here "sufficiently large" means there exists a threshold $k_0$ depending on $\varepsilon$
(but not on $n$) such that the bound holds for all $k \geq k_0$ with $k < n$.

Erdős Problem 679, Part 2 (disproved by DottedCalculator) [Er79d]:

The stronger version asking whether $\omega(n - k) < \log k / \log \log k + O(1)$
holds for infinitely many $n$ is false. In fact, there exists a constant $c > 0$
such that for all sufficiently large $n$, there exists $k < n$ with
$$\omega(n - k) \geq \log k / \log \log k + c \cdot \log k / (\log \log k)^2.$$
