# Erdős Problem 842

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/842](https://www.erdosproblems.com/842)

Let $G$ be a graph on $3n$ vertices formed by taking $n$ vertex disjoint triangles
and adding a Hamiltonian cycle (with all new edges) between these vertices.
Does $G$ have chromatic number at most $3$?

The answer is yes, proved by Fleischner and Stiebitz [FlSt92].
