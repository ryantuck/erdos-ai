# Erdős Problem 986

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/986](https://www.erdosproblems.com/986)

Spencer [Sp77] proved the $k = 3$ case and Mattheus and Verstraëte [MaVe23]
proved the $k = 4$ case.

The best general bounds available are:
$$
n^{(k+1)/2} / (\log n)^{1/(k-2) - (k+1)/2} \ll_k R(k,n) \ll_k n^{k-1} / (\log n)^{k-2}
$$
The lower bound was proved by Bohman and Keevash [BoKe10].
The upper bound was proved by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi [AKS80].

Erdős Conjecture (Problem #986) [Er90b]:

For any fixed $k \geq 3$, there exist constants $C > 0$ and $c \in \mathbb{N}$ with $c > 0$
such that for all sufficiently large $n$:
$$
R(k,n) \geq C \cdot n^{k-1} / (\log n)^c.
$$
In asymptotic notation: $R(k,n) \gg n^{k-1}/(\log n)^c$ for some $c > 0$.
