Erdős Problem 1163 (Erdős and Turán) [Va99, 5.74]:
Describe (by statistical means) the arithmetic structure of the orders of
subgroups of $S_n$.

The original problem is acknowledged as ambiguous. A concrete
interpretation: as $n \to \infty$, the proportion of divisors of $n!$ that are orders
of subgroups of $S_n$ tends to $0$. By Lagrange's theorem, every subgroup order
divides $n!$, but the set of subgroup orders becomes a vanishingly small
fraction of all divisors.
