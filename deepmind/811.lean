# Erdős Problem 811

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/811](https://www.erdosproblems.com/811)

Suppose $n \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$. We say that an edge-colouring of $K_n$ using $m$ colours
is balanced if every vertex sees exactly $\lfloor n/m \rfloor$ edges of each colour.

For which graphs $G$ is it true that, if $m = e(G)$, for all large $n \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$,
every balanced edge-colouring of $K_n$ with $m$ colours contains a rainbow copy
of $G$? (That is, a subgraph isomorphic to $G$ where each edge receives a
different colour.)

A problem of Erdős, Pyber, and Tuza.

**Erdős Problem 811** (specific challenge from [Er91] and [Er96]):

For all sufficiently large $n \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$, every balanced edge-colouring
of $K_n$ with $6$ colours contains a rainbow copy of $C_6$.

The companion question about $K_4$ (which also has $6$ edges) was answered
negatively by Clemen and Wagner [ClWa23].
