Erdős Problem 117 [Er90, Er97f, Va99]:

Let $h(n)$ be minimal such that any group $G$ satisfying the property that every
subset of more than $n$ elements contains distinct commuting elements $x \neq y$
($xy = yx$) can be covered by at most $h(n)$ Abelian subgroups.

Estimate $h(n)$ as well as possible.

Pyber [Py87] proved there exist constants $c_2 > c_1 > 1$ such that
$$c_1^n < h(n) < c_2^n.$$
The lower bound $c_1^n < h(n)$ was already known to Isaacs [Er97f].
The precise exponential growth rate of $h(n)$ remains open.
