# Erdős Problem 608

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/608](https://www.erdosproblems.com/608)

Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and more than $n^2/4$ edges. Are there at least
$(2/9)n^2$ edges of $G$ which are contained in a $C_5$?

This was disproved. Füredi and Maleki constructed graphs with more than $n^2/4$ edges
where at most $c \cdot n^2 + O(n)$ edges are in a $C_5$, with
$c = (2 + \sqrt{2})/16 \approx 0.2134$. Grzesik, Hu, and Volec [GHV19] proved this is
optimal: any graph with more than $n^2/4$ edges contains at least $(c - o(1)) \cdot n^2$
edges in a $C_5$.

/-- The number of edges of $G$ contained in some $5$-cycle. An edge $\{u, v\}$ is
in a $C_5$ if there exist vertices $w_1, w_2, w_3$ (all five pairwise distinct)
such that $u$-$w_1$-$w_2$-$w_3$-$v$-$u$ is a $5$-cycle in $G$. Edges are counted as
ordered pairs $(u, v)$ with $u < v$ to avoid double-counting. -/

**Erdős Problem 608** (Disproved) [EFR92, Er97d]:

If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with more than $n^2/4$ edges, then at least
$(2/9) \cdot n^2$ edges of $G$ are contained in a $C_5$.

This is false. The correct threshold is $c = (2+\sqrt{2})/16 \approx 0.2134$, proved
optimal by Grzesik, Hu, and Volec [GHV19].
