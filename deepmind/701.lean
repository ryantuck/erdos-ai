Chvátal's Conjecture: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of finite sets closed under taking subsets
(i.e. if $B \subseteq A \in \mathcal{F}$ then $B \in \mathcal{F}$). There exists some element $x$
such that whenever $\mathcal{F}' \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ is an intersecting subfamily we have
$|\mathcal{F}'| \leq |\{A \in \mathcal{F} : x \in A\}|$.

Equivalently, the maximum intersecting subfamily of a downward-closed family has size at most the
maximum degree.
