/--
Let $(\varepsilon_k)_{k \geq 0}$ be independently uniformly chosen at random from $\{-1, 1\}$.
If $R_n$ counts the number of real roots of $f_n(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \varepsilon_k z^k$,
then, almost surely, $\lim_{n \to \infty} R_n / \log n = 2/\pi$.

Erdős and Offord showed that the number of real roots of a random degree $n$
polynomial with $\pm 1$ coefficients is $(2/\pi + o(1)) \log n$ in expectation.
This conjecture asks whether the convergence holds almost surely.
