Erdős Problem 1124 (Tarski's circle-squaring problem, proved):

Can a square and a circle of the same area be decomposed into a finite number
of congruent parts?

A problem of Tarski, which Erdős described as 'a very beautiful problem...if it
were my problem I would offer \$1000 for it'.

Laczkovich [La90b] proved that this is possible using translations only.

Formally: the unit square and the closed disk of radius $1/\sqrt{\pi}$ (both having area $1$)
can be partitioned into finitely many pieces such that corresponding pieces are
congruent (related by isometries of $\mathbb{R}^2$).
