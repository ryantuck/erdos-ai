# Erdős Problem 673

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/673](https://www.erdosproblems.com/673)

Let $1 = d_1 < \cdots < d_{\tau(n)} = n$ be the divisors of $n$ and
$$G(n) = \sum_{1 \leq i < \tau(n)} d_i / d_{i+1}.$$

Is it true that $G(n) \to \infty$ for almost all $n$? Can one prove an asymptotic
formula for $\sum_{n \leq X} G(n)$?

Erdős writes it is 'easy' to prove $(1/X) \sum_{n \leq X} G(n) \to \infty$.

Terence Tao observed that for any divisor $m \mid n$,
$\tau(n/m) / m \leq G(n) \leq \tau(n)$,
and hence for example $\tau(n)/4 \leq G(n) \leq \tau(n)$ for even $n$. It follows easily
that $G(n)$ grows on average and tends to infinity for almost all $n$.

Erdős and Tenenbaum proved that $G(n)/\tau(n)$ has a continuous distribution
function.

Erdős Problem 673, Part 1 [Er79e, Er82e]:

$G(n) \to \infty$ for almost all $n$, i.e., for every $M$, the set of $n$ with $G(n) \leq M$
has natural density zero.
