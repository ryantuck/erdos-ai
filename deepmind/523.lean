Erdős Problem #523:
Let $f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^n \varepsilon_k z^k$ be a random polynomial, where
$\varepsilon_k \in \{-1, 1\}$ independently uniformly at random.

Does there exist some constant $C > 0$ such that, almost surely,
$$\max_{|z|=1} \left|\sum_{k \le n} \varepsilon_k z^k\right| = (C + o(1))\sqrt{n \log n}?$$

Salem and Zygmund proved that $\sqrt{n \log n}$ is the right order of magnitude.
This was settled by Halász, who proved this is true with $C = 1$.
