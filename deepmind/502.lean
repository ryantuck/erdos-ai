A finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a two-distance set if there are exactly
two distinct positive real numbers that occur as distances between pairs
of distinct points.

Erdős Problem 502 — Bannai–Bannai–Stanton Upper Bound [Er61] [BBS83]:

What is the size of the largest $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ such that there are only two
distinct distances between elements of $A$?

Originally asked to Erdős by Coxeter. Bannai, Bannai, and Stanton proved
that $|A| \le \binom{n+2}{2}$. A simpler proof was given by Petrov and Pohoata
[PePo21]. The best known lower bound is $\binom{n+1}{2}$ via a construction
of Alweiss.
