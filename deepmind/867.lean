/-- A finite set $A$ of natural numbers is "consecutive-sum-free" if, when its
elements are listed in increasing order as $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_t$, no sum of
two or more consecutive elements ($a_i + a_{i+1} + \cdots + a_j$ with $i < j$)
lies in $A$. -/

Erdős Problem 867 (disproved) [Er92c]:

Is it true that if $A = \{a_1 < \cdots < a_t\} \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ has no sum of two or
more consecutive elements in $A$, then $|A| \le N/2 + C$ for some absolute constant $C$?

Disproved by Coppersmith and Phillips [CoPh96], who proved the maximum $|A|$ satisfies
$$
  \frac{13}{24} N - O(1) \le |A| \le \left(\frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{512}\right) N + \log N.
$$
