Erdős Problem 130 [Er97b] (asked by Andrásfai and Erdős):
Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be an infinite set with no three points collinear and no four
points concyclic. Consider the integer-distance graph $G$ on $A$, where two distinct points
are adjacent if and only if their Euclidean distance is a positive integer.

Can the chromatic number of $G$ be infinite?

Note: The clique number is always finite. The Anning–Erdős theorem [AnEr45]
shows that any infinite set of points in the plane with all pairwise integer
distances must be collinear; since $A$ has no three collinear points, $A$ contains
no infinite complete subgraph.
