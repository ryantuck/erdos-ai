# Erdős Problem 431

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/431](https://www.erdosproblems.com/431)

Are there two infinite sets $A$ and $B$ of natural numbers such that the sumset
$A + B = \{a + b \mid a \in A, b \in B\}$ agrees with the set of prime numbers up to
finitely many exceptions?

This is a problem of Ostmann, sometimes known as the 'inverse Goldbach problem'.
The expected answer is no.

Elsholtz and Harper [ElHa15] showed that if $A$, $B$ are such sets then for all
large $x$ we must have
$x^{1/2}/(\log x \cdot \log \log x) \ll |A \cap [1,x]| \ll x^{1/2} \cdot \log \log x$
and similarly for $B$.

Elsholtz [El01] proved there are no sets $A$, $B$, $C$ (all of size at least 2) such that
$A + B + C$ agrees with the primes up to finitely many exceptions.

Erdős Problem 431 [ErGr80]:

There do not exist two infinite sets $A$ and $B$ of natural numbers such that the
sumset $A + B = \{a + b \mid a \in A, b \in B\}$ agrees with the set of prime numbers
up to finitely many exceptions (i.e., the symmetric difference is finite).
