# Erdős Problem 178

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/178](https://www.erdosproblems.com/178)

Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be an infinite collection of infinite sets of integers,
say $A_i = \{a_{i1} < a_{i2} < \cdots\}$. Does there exist some
$f : \mathbb{N} \to \{-1, 1\}$ such that
$$\max_{m,\; 1 \leq i \leq d} \left|\sum_{1 \leq j \leq m} f(a_{ij})\right| \ll_d 1$$
for all $d \geq 1$?

Erdős remarked "it seems certain that the answer is affirmative". This was proved by
Beck [Be81]. Beck [Be17] later proved that one can replace $\ll_d 1$ with
$\ll d^{4+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$.

Erdős Problem 178 [ErGr79, ErGr80]:
Given any infinite sequence of infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ (each represented by
its strictly increasing enumeration $a(i, \cdot) : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$), there exists a
coloring $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(n) \in \{-1, 1\}$ such that for each $d$, the partial
sums of $f$ along the first $d$ sequences are uniformly bounded by a constant
depending only on $d$.

Proved by Beck [Be81].
