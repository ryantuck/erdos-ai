Erdős Problem 301 [ErGr80]:

Let $f(N)$ be the size of the largest $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ such that there are no
solutions to $1/a = 1/b_1 + \cdots + 1/b_k$ with distinct $a, b_1, \ldots, b_k \in A$.

Estimate $f(N)$. In particular, is it true that $f(N) = (1/2 + o(1))N$?

The example $A = (N/2, N] \cap \mathbb{N}$ shows that $f(N) \geq N/2$. Wouter van Doorn
has shown $f(N) \leq (25/28 + o(1))N$.

We formalize the conjectured statement: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all
sufficiently large $N$,
(1) every unit-fraction-sum-free $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ has
$|A| \leq (1/2 + \varepsilon)N$, and
(2) there exists a unit-fraction-sum-free $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ with
$|A| \geq (1/2 - \varepsilon)N$.
