# Erdős Problem 110

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/110](https://www.erdosproblems.com/110)

[EHS82] Erdős, P., Hajnal, A., and Szemerédi, E. — original conjecture.

[KoSh05] Komjáth, P. and Shelah, S. — proved it is consistent with ZFC that the answer is no.

[La20] Lambie-Hanson, C. — constructed a ZFC counterexample.

A graph $G$ (on vertex type $V$) has chromatic number $\aleph_1$ if:
(1) $G$ cannot be properly colored by any countable set of colors
    (i.e., the chromatic number exceeds $\aleph_0$), and
(2) $G$ can be properly colored by a set of cardinality $\aleph_1$.

Erdős-Hajnal-Szemerédi Conjecture (Problem #110):
Is there some function $F : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G$ with chromatic
number $\aleph_1$ has, for all sufficiently large $n$, a subgraph with chromatic number $n$ on at
most $F(n)$ vertices?

Conjectured by Erdős, Hajnal, and Szemerédi [EHS82].
The analogous statement fails for graphs of chromatic number $\aleph_0$.
Shelah [KoSh05] proved it is consistent with ZFC that the answer is no.
Lambie-Hanson [La20] constructed a ZFC counterexample, so the conjecture is **false**.
