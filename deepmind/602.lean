# Erdős Problem 602

A problem of Komjáth. The existence of such a $2$-colouring is sometimes known as
Property B.

Erdős Problem 602 [Er87]:

Let $(A_i)$ be a family of sets with $|A_i| = \aleph_0$ for all $i$, such that
for any $i \neq j$, $|A_i \cap A_j|$ is finite and $\neq 1$. Then the family
has Property B: there is a $2$-colouring of $\bigcup A_i$ such that no $A_i$ is
monochromatic.
