# Erdős Problem 22

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/22](https://www.erdosproblems.com/22)

Let $\varepsilon > 0$ and $n$ be sufficiently large depending on $\varepsilon$. Is there a graph on
$n$ vertices with $\geq n^2/8$ many edges which contains no $K_4$ such that the largest
independent set has size at most $\varepsilon n$?

Equivalently: $\mathrm{rt}(n; 4, \varepsilon n) \geq n^2/8$ for sufficiently large $n$, where
$\mathrm{rt}(n; k, \ell)$ is the Ramsey–Turán number.

Conjectured by Bollobás and Erdős [BoEr76], who proved the existence of such a graph with
$(1/8 + o(1))n^2$ many edges. Proved by Fox, Loh, and Zhao [FLZ15], who showed that for every
$n \geq 1$ there exists a $K_4$-free graph on $n$ vertices with $\geq n^2/8$ edges and
independence number $\ll (\log \log n)^{3/2} / (\log n)^{1/2} \cdot n$.

**Erdős Problem 22** (Bollobás–Erdős Conjecture on Ramsey–Turán numbers,
proved by Fox, Loh, and Zhao [FLZ15]):

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $n$, there exists a graph $G$ on $n$
vertices such that:
- $G$ has at least $n^2/8$ edges,
- $G$ contains no $K_4$ (no clique of size 4),
- every independent set in $G$ has size at most $\varepsilon \cdot n$.
