/-- A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is *dissociated* if all finite subset sums are distinct:
for any two distinct finite subsets $X \neq Y$ of $A$, $\sum X \neq \sum Y$. -/
def Dissociated (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ X Y : Finset ℕ, ↑X ⊆ A → ↑Y ⊆ A → X ≠ Y → X.sum id ≠ Y.sum id

/-- A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is *proportionately dissociated* if there exists $c > 0$ such
that every finite subset $B \subseteq A$ contains a dissociated subset of size
$\geq c \cdot |B|$. -/

**Erdős Problem 774** (Alon–Erdős [AlEr85]):
Is every proportionately dissociated set the union of finitely many
dissociated sets?
