A biclique cover of a simple graph $G$ of size $k$ consists of $k$ complete bipartite
subgraphs (specified by pairs of disjoint vertex sets) that are pairwise
edge-disjoint and together cover all edges of $G$.

Erdős Problem 807 (disproved by Alon [Al15]):

Is it true that for a random graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with edge probability $1/2$,
$\tau(G) = n - \alpha(G)$ almost surely?

The bipartition number $\tau(G)$ is the smallest number of pairwise edge-disjoint
complete bipartite graphs whose union is $G$. The independence number $\alpha(G)$ is
the size of the largest independent set in $G$.

In the $G(n, 1/2)$ model every labeled graph on $n$ vertices is equally likely, so
"almost surely" means the proportion of graphs satisfying the property tends
to $1$ as $n \to \infty$.

Alon [Al15] showed this is false: almost surely $\tau(G) \leq n - \alpha(G) - 1$.
Alon, Bohman, and Huang [ABH17] proved there exists $c > 0$ such that
almost surely $\tau(G) \leq n - (1 + c)\alpha(G)$.
