# Erdős Problem 729

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/729](https://www.erdosproblems.com/729)

Erdős proved that if $a! b! \mid n!$ then $a + b \le n + O(\log n)$. This problem asks
whether the same bound holds when divisibility is only required "up to small
primes," i.e., the denominator of $n!/(a! b!)$ is supported only on bounded primes.

The answer is yes (the bound still holds). Proved by Barreto and Leeham.

Erdős Problem 729 [EGRS75]:

For any $C > 0$ and any prime bound $P$, the set of triples $(a, b, n)$ such that
$a + b > n + C \cdot \log n$ and the denominator of $n!/(a! b!)$ is $P$-smooth, is finite.
