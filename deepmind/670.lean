All pairwise distances in a finite point set are separated by at least $1$:
for any two distinct unordered pairs $\{a, b\}$ and $\{c, d\}$ of points from $A$
(where $a \neq b$ and $c \neq d$), $|d(a, b) - d(c, d)| \geq 1$.

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be a set of $n$ points such that all pairwise distances differ by
at least $1$. Is the diameter of $A$ at least $(1 + o(1))n^2$?

The lower bound of $\binom{n}{2}$ for the diameter is trivial. Erdős [Er97f] proved
the claim when $d = 1$.

Formalized as: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, for
every dimension $d$ and every set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with all pairwise
distances differing by at least $1$, the diameter of $A$ is at least $(1 - \varepsilon) \cdot n^2$.
