# Erdős Problem 604

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/604](https://www.erdosproblems.com/604)

Given $n$ distinct points $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, must there be a point $x \in A$ such that
$$\#\{ d(x,y) : y \in A\} \gg n/\sqrt{\log n}?$$

This is the pinned distance problem, a stronger form of Problem \#89 (the distinct
distances problem). The example of an integer grid shows that $n/\sqrt{\log n}$ would
be best possible.

The best known bound is $\gg n^{c - o(1)}$ where $c = (48 - 14e)/(55 - 16e) = 0.8641\ldots$,
due to Katz and Tardos.

Erdős Problem 604 [Er57][Er61]:

Given $n$ distinct points $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, there must exist a point $x \in A$ such that
the number of distinct distances from $x$ to other points in $A$ is
$\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$.

Formally: there exists a constant $C > 0$ and a threshold $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$
and every set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, some point $x \in A$ has at least
$C \cdot n / \sqrt{\log n}$ distinct pinned distances.

The integer grid shows this would be best possible.
