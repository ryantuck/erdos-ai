# Erdős Problem 150

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/150](https://www.erdosproblems.com/150)

A minimal cut of a graph is a minimal set of vertices whose removal disconnects
the graph. Let $c(n)$ be the maximum number of minimal cuts a graph on $n$ vertices
can have. Does $c(n)^{1/n} \to \alpha$ for some $\alpha < 2$?

Asked by Erdős and Nešetřil. Seymour observed that $c(3m+2) \geq 3^m$ via $m$
independent paths of length $4$ joining two vertices.

Proved by Bradač [Br24]: the limit $\alpha = \lim c(n)^{1/n}$ exists and
$\alpha \leq 2^{H(1/3)} = 1.8899\ldots < 2$, where $H(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy
function. This confirms the conjecture. Bradač conjectures the true value is
$\alpha = 3^{1/3}$.

Erdős Problem 150 [Er88] (asked by Erdős and Nešetřil):
Let $c(n)$ be the maximum number of minimal vertex cuts in a graph on $n$ vertices.
Does $c(n)^{1/n} \to \alpha$ for some $\alpha < 2$?

Proved by Bradač [Br24]: the limit $\alpha = \lim c(n)^{1/n}$ exists and
$\alpha \leq 2^{H(1/3)} = 1.8899\ldots < 2$, where $H(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy
function. Seymour's construction gives $c(3m+2) \geq 3^m$, so
$\alpha \geq 3^{1/3} \approx 1.442$. Bradač conjectures that the true value is
$\alpha = 3^{1/3}$.
