/-- **Erdős Problem 716** (Brown-Erdős-Sós conjecture [BES73], proved by Ruzsa-Szemerédi
[RuSz78]): $\mathrm{ex}_3(n, \mathcal{F}) = o(n^2)$, i.e., for any $\varepsilon > 0$,
every sufficiently large $\mathcal{F}$-free 3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices has at most
$\varepsilon \cdot n^2$ edges. -/
