# Erdős Problem 1134

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1134](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1134)

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be the smallest set which contains $1$ and is closed under the
operations $x \mapsto 2x+1$, $x \mapsto 3x+1$, and $x \mapsto 6x+1$. Does $A$ have positive
lower density?

This was disproved by Crampin and Hilton, who showed that
$|A \cap [1,X]| \ll X^{\tau+o(1)}$ where $\tau \approx 0.900626 < 1$ is the unique positive
root of $6^{-\tau} + \sum_{k \geq 0} (3 \cdot 2^k)^{-\tau} = 1$. In particular, $A$ has
density $0$.

Erdős Problem 1134 [La16]:

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be the smallest set containing $1$ and closed under $x \mapsto 2x+1$,
$x \mapsto 3x+1$, and $x \mapsto 6x+1$. Then $A$ does not have positive lower density;
in fact the natural density of $A$ is $0$.

Disproved (answered in the negative) by Crampin and Hilton, who showed
$|A \cap [1,X]| \ll X^{\tau+o(1)}$ where $\tau \approx 0.900626 < 1$.
