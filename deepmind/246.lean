Erdős Problem 246 [Er61] (proved by Birch [Bi59]):
Let $a, b \geq 2$ with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Then every sufficiently large positive integer
is the sum of distinct integers of the form $a^k \cdot b^\ell$ with $k, \ell \geq 0$.

This also follows from a later more general result of Cassels [Ca60] (see Problem 254).
