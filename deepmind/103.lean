A finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is unit-separated if all pairwise distances
between distinct points are at least $1$.

The diameter of a finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$: the supremum of all pairwise distances.

A configuration of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ minimizes the diameter among all unit-separated
$n$-point configurations: it is unit-separated, and no other unit-separated $n$-point set
has strictly smaller diameter.

  IsUnitSeparated A ∧
  ∀ B : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)),
    B.card = A.card → IsUnitSeparated B → finiteDiameter A ≤ finiteDiameter B

Two finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are congruent if there is an isometric equivalence of
$\mathbb{R}^2$ mapping one to the other (i.e., one can be obtained from the other by a
rigid motion).

$h(n)$ counts the number of congruence classes of minimal-diameter unit-separated
$n$-point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^2$. That is, it counts the number of incongruent sets
of $n$ points that minimize the diameter subject to $d(x,y) \geq 1$ for all $x \neq y$.

Erdős Problem #103:
Let $h(n)$ count the number of incongruent sets of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ which minimize
the diameter subject to the constraint that $d(x,y) \geq 1$ for all distinct points
$x$, $y$. Is it true that $h(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$?

It is not even known whether $h(n) \geq 2$ for all sufficiently large $n$.
