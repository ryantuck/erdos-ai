Erdős Problem 1147 [Va99, 1.21]:

Let $\alpha > 0$ be an irrational number. Is the set
$$A = \{ n \ge 1 : \lVert \alpha n^2 \rVert < 1 / \log n \},$$
where $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ denotes the distance to the nearest integer, an additive basis
of order $2$?

This was disproved by Konieczny [Ko16b]. In particular, for $\alpha = \sqrt{2}$,
the set $A$ is not an additive basis of order $2$.
