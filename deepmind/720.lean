# Erdős Problem 720

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/720](https://www.erdosproblems.com/720)

Let $\hat{R}(G)$ denote the size Ramsey number, the minimal number of edges $m$ such
that there is a graph $H$ with $m$ edges such that in any 2-colouring of the
edges of $H$ there is a monochromatic copy of $G$.

The original questions asked:
1. Is it true that $\hat{R}(P_n)/n \to \infty$?
2. Is it true that $\hat{R}(P_n)/n^2 \to 0$?
3. Is it true that $\hat{R}(C_n) = o(n^2)$?

Answered by Beck [Be83b], who proved the much stronger result that
$\hat{R}(P_n) \ll n$ and $\hat{R}(C_n) \ll n$ (i.e., the size Ramsey numbers are linear).

This resolves all three questions:
- Question 1 is answered in the negative ($\hat{R}(P_n)/n$ is bounded).
- Questions 2 and 3 are answered in the affirmative (in a much stronger form).

/-- The size Ramsey number $\hat{R}(G)$: the minimum number of edges in a graph $H$
    that is Ramsey for $G$.

    A graph $H$ on $N$ vertices is Ramsey for $G$ if every 2-coloring of the edges
    of $H$ contains a monochromatic copy of $G$, i.e., an injective map $f$ from the
    vertices of $G$ into $\operatorname{Fin} N$ that preserves adjacency in $H$ and maps all
    edges to the same color. -/

Erdős Problem 720, Part 1 (Beck's theorem for paths) [Be83b]:

The size Ramsey number of the path $P_n$ is at most linear in $n$.
That is, there exists a constant $C$ such that $\hat{R}(P_n) \leq C \cdot (n + 1)$ for all $n$.

This disproves the conjecture that $\hat{R}(P_n)/n \to \infty$ and proves
$\hat{R}(P_n)/n^2 \to 0$.

Erdős Problem 720, Part 2 (Beck's theorem for cycles) [Be83b]:

The size Ramsey number of the cycle $C_n$ is at most linear in $n$.
That is, there exists a constant $C$ such that $\hat{R}(C_n) \leq C \cdot n$ for all $n \geq 3$.

This proves (in a much stronger form) the conjecture that $\hat{R}(C_n) = o(n^2)$.
