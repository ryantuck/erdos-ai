A finite system of congruences $\{(a_i, m_i)\}$ is a **covering system** if every
modulus is positive and every integer satisfies at least one congruence $n \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}$.

Erdős asked whether the smallest modulus of a covering system can be arbitrarily
large (he expected the answer to be yes). Hough [Hou15], building on work of
Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance, and Yu [FFKPY07], showed the answer is **no**:
every covering system has smallest modulus at most $10^{16}$. Balister, Bollobás,
Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba [BBMST22] gave a simpler proof and improved the
bound to $616000$. The best known lower bound is $42$, due to Owens [Ow14].

Formally: there exists an absolute constant $B$ such that every covering system
contains a congruence whose modulus is at most $B$.
