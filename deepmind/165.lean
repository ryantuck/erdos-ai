# Erdős Problem 165

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/165](https://www.erdosproblems.com/165)

Give an asymptotic formula for $R(3,k)$.

$R(3,k)$ is the Ramsey number: the minimum $N$ such that every simple graph
on $N$ vertices contains either a triangle ($3$-clique) or an independent set
of size $k$ (equivalently, a $k$-clique in the complement).

It is known that for some constant $c > 0$ and large $k$:
$$
  (c + o(1)) \frac{k^2}{\log k} \leq R(3,k) \leq (1 + o(1)) \frac{k^2}{\log k}
$$

The upper bound is due to Shearer [Sh83], improving Ajtai–Komlós–Szemerédi
[AKS80]. The lower bound constant has been improved to $c \geq 1/2$ by
Hefty–Horn–King–Pfender [HHKP25]. The conjectured asymptotic is
$R(3,k) \sim \frac{1}{2} \frac{k^2}{\log k}$.

Erdős Conjecture (Problem 165) [Er61, Er71, Er90b, Er93, Er97c]:

There exists a constant $c > 0$ such that $R(3,k) \sim c \cdot k^2 / \log k$, i.e.,
for all $\varepsilon > 0$ and all sufficiently large $k$:
$$
  (c - \varepsilon) \cdot \frac{k^2}{\log k} \leq R(3,k) \leq (c + \varepsilon) \cdot \frac{k^2}{\log k}.
$$

The conjectured value is $c = 1/2$.
