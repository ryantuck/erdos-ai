# Erdős Problem 843

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/843](https://www.erdosproblems.com/843)

A problem of Burr and Erdős [BuEr85]. Proved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham [CFP21],
who showed that the set of $k$-th powers contains a sparse Ramsey $r$-complete
subsequence for every $r, k \geq 2$.

Erdős Problem 843 [BuEr85][Er92b][Er95]:
The set of perfect squares is Ramsey $2$-complete. That is, for any
$2$-colouring of the squares, every sufficiently large natural number
can be written as a monochromatic sum of distinct squares.

Proved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham [CFP21].
