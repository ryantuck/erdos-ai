The Schnirelmann density of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, defined as
$$d_s(A) = \inf_{n \geq 1} \frac{|A \cap \{1,\ldots,n\}|}{n}$$

The sumset $A + B = \{a + b \mid a \in A, b \in B\}$ for sets of natural numbers.

A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is an *essential component* if $d_s(A + B) > d_s(B)$ for every
$B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 < d_s(B) < 1$, where $d_s$ is the Schnirelmann density.

def IsEssentialComponent (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (B : Set ℕ), 0 < schnirelmannDensity B → schnirelmannDensity B < 1 →
    schnirelmannDensity (sumset A B) > schnirelmannDensity B

/--
A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is *lacunary* if there exists $q > 1$ such that for any two
consecutive elements $a < b$ of $A$ (with no element of $A$ strictly between them),
we have $b \geq q \cdot a$.

def IsLacunary (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ (q : ℝ), q > 1 ∧ ∀ (a b : ℕ), a ∈ A → b ∈ A → a < b →
    (∀ c ∈ A, ¬(a < c ∧ c < b)) → (b : ℝ) ≥ q * (a : ℝ)

/--
Erdős Problem 37, proved by Ruzsa [Ru87].
A lacunary set cannot be an essential component.
Ruzsa proved that if $A$ is an essential component then there exists some constant
$c > 0$ such that $|A \cap \{1,\ldots,N\}| \geq (\log N)^{1+c}$ for all large $N$, which rules
out lacunary sets (which satisfy $|A \cap \{1,\ldots,N\}| = O(\log N)$).
