# Erdős Problem 964

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/964](https://www.erdosproblems.com/964)

Let $\tau(n)$ count the number of divisors of $n$. Is the sequence
$\tau(n+1)/\tau(n)$ everywhere dense in $(0,\infty)$?

This has been proved unconditionally by Eberhard [Eb25], who in fact showed
that every positive rational can be written as such a ratio.

Erdős Problem 964 [Er86b]:

The set $\{\tau(n+1)/\tau(n) : n \geq 1\}$ is dense in $(0, \infty)$.

For every positive real $r$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $n \geq 1$
such that $|\tau(n+1)/\tau(n) - r| < \varepsilon$.

Proved by Eberhard [Eb25].

theorem erdos_964 :
    ∀ r : ℝ, r > 0 → ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 →
    ∃ n : ℕ, n ≥ 1 ∧
      |((Nat.divisors (n + 1)).card : ℝ) / ((Nat.divisors n).card : ℝ) - r| < ε := by
