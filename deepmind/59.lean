# Erdős Problem 59

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/59](https://www.erdosproblems.com/59)

[Er90, Er93, Er97c, Va99] are the original references. Erdős, Frankl, and Rödl [EFR86]
proved the answer is yes when $G$ is not bipartite. Morris and Saxton [MoSa16] showed
counterexamples for $G = C_6$.

Erdős Problem 59 [Er90, Er93, Er97c, Va99]:

Is it true that, for every graph $G$, the number of labeled graphs on $n$ vertices that
contain no copy of $G$ is at most $2^{(1+o(1)) \cdot \operatorname{ex}(n; G)}$?

That is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $n$:
$$\#\{\text{$G$-free graphs on $[n]$}\} \leq 2^{(1+\varepsilon) \cdot \operatorname{ex}(n; G)}$$

This was DISPROVED: the answer is no for $G = C_6$ (the 6-cycle).
Erdős, Frankl, and Rödl [EFR86] proved the answer is yes when $G$ is not bipartite.
Morris and Saxton [MoSa16] showed there are at least $2^{(1+c) \cdot \operatorname{ex}(n; C_6)}$
such graphs for infinitely many $n$, for some constant $c > 0$.
