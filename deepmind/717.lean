# Erdős Problem 717

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/717](https://www.erdosproblems.com/717)

Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with chromatic number $\chi(G)$ and let $\sigma(G)$ be
the maximal $k$ such that $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_k$. Is it true that
$$\chi(G) \ll \frac{n^{1/2}}{\log n} \cdot \sigma(G)?$$

Hajós originally conjectured that $\chi(G) \leq \sigma(G)$, which was proved by Dirac
when $\chi(G) = 4$. Catlin disproved Hajós' conjecture for all $\chi(G) \geq 7$, and
Erdős and Fajtlowicz disproved it in a strong form, showing that for almost
all graphs on $n$ vertices, $\chi(G) \gg \frac{n^{1/2}}{\log n} \cdot \sigma(G)$.

The answer is yes, proved by Fox, Lee, and Sudakov [FLS13].

**Erdős Problem 717** (PROVED, Fox–Lee–Sudakov [FLS13]):

For every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices,
$$\chi(G) \leq C \cdot \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log n} \cdot \sigma(G)$$
for some absolute constant $C > 0$.
