# Erdős Problem 1155

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1155](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1155)

Construct a random graph on $n$ vertices in the following way: begin with the complete graph
$K_n$. At each stage, choose uniformly a random triangle in the graph and delete all the edges
of this triangle. Repeat until the graph is triangle-free. If $f(n)$ is the number of edges
remaining, is it true that $\mathbb{E}[f(n)] \asymp n^{3/2}$ and that $f(n) \ll n^{3/2}$
almost surely?

A problem of Bollobás and Erdős [Bo98, p.231][Va99, 3.61].

Bohman, Frieze, and Lubetzky [BFL15] proved that $f(n) = n^{3/2 + o(1)}$ a.s.

Erdős Problem #1155, Part 1 [Bo98, p.231]:

$\mathbb{E}[f(n)] \asymp n^{3/2}$, i.e., there exist constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$ such that for all
sufficiently large $n$, $c_1 \cdot n^{3/2} \leq \mathbb{E}[f(n)] \leq c_2 \cdot n^{3/2}$.
