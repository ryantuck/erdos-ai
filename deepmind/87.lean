# Erdős Problem 87

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/87](https://www.erdosproblems.com/87)

[Er95] Erdős, P., _Problems and results in combinatorial analysis and graph theory_, 1995, p. 14.

Erdős originally conjectured $R(G) \geq R(k)$ for all $G$ with $\chi(G) = k$, which fails
already for $k = 4$: Faudree and McKay showed $R(W) = 17 < 18 = R(4)$ for the
pentagonal wheel $W$.

**Erdős Problem 87** — Weak form (open). [Er95, p. 14]

Let $\varepsilon > 0$. Is it true that, if $k$ is sufficiently large, then
$$R(G) > (1 - \varepsilon)^k \cdot R(k)$$
for every graph $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G) = k$?

**Erdős Problem 87** — Strong form (open). [Er95, p. 14]

Is there some $c > 0$ such that, for all large $k$,
$$R(G) > c \cdot R(k)$$
for every graph $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G) = k$?
