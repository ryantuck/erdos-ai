# Erdős Problem 27

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/27](https://www.erdosproblems.com/27)

An $\varepsilon$-almost covering system is a set of congruences $a_i \pmod{n_i}$ for distinct
moduli $n_1 < \cdots < n_k$ such that the natural density of integers satisfying none of them
is at most $\varepsilon$.

Erdős asked whether there exists a constant $C > 1$ such that for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and
$N \geq 1$, there is an $\varepsilon$-almost covering system with $N \leq n_1 < \cdots < n_k \leq CN$.
This was disproved by Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance, and Yu [FFKPY07].

The density of uncovered integers for a congruence system, measured as the proportion of
integers in $\{0, \ldots, L-1\}$ not covered by any congruence, where $L$ is the LCM of
all moduli.

/--
There is no constant $C > 1$ such that for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and $N \geq 1$, there
exists an $\varepsilon$-almost covering system whose moduli all lie in the interval $[N, CN]$.

Erdős conjectured this was possible; it was disproved by Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin,
Pomerance, and Yu [FFKPY07].
