# Erdős Problem 708

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/708](https://www.erdosproblems.com/708)

Let $g(n)$ be minimal such that for any $A \subseteq [2,\infty) \cap \mathbb{N}$ with
$|A| = n$ and any set $I$ of $\max(A)$ consecutive integers there exists some
$B \subseteq I$ with $|B| = g(n)$ such that $\prod_{a \in A} a \mid \prod_{b \in B} b$.

Is it true that $g(n) \leq (2+o(1))n$? Or perhaps even $g(n) \leq 2n$?

A problem of Erdős and Surányi [ErSu59], who proved that $g(n) \geq (2-o(1))n$,
and that $g(3) = 4$. Gallai first considered such problems and observed $g(2) = 2$.

Erdős Problem 708 (weak form) [ErSu59]: $g(n) \leq (2+o(1))n$.

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N_0$ such that for all nonempty
$A \subseteq \{2, 3, \ldots\}$ with $|A| \geq N_0$ and every interval of $\max(A)$
consecutive natural numbers starting at $k$, there exists a subset $B$ of that interval
with $|B| \leq (2+\varepsilon)|A|$ whose product is divisible by the product of $A$.

Erdős Problem 708 (strong form) [ErSu59]: $g(n) \leq 2n$.

For every nonempty finite set $A \subseteq \{2, 3, \ldots\}$ and every interval of
$\max(A)$ consecutive natural numbers starting at $k$, there exists a subset $B$ of that
interval with $|B| \leq 2|A|$ whose product is divisible by the product of $A$.
