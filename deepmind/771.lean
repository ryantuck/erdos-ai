# Erdős Problem 771

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/771](https://www.erdosproblems.com/771)

Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that, for every $m \geq 1$, there exists some
$S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ with $|S| = f(n)$ such that $m \neq \sum_{a \in A} a$
for all $A \subseteq S$.

Is it true that $f(n) = (\tfrac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot n / \log n$?

The lower bound $f(n) \geq (\tfrac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot n / \log n$ was proved by Erdős
and Graham, who took $S = \{kp : 1 \leq k < n/p\}$ where $p$ is the least prime not
dividing $m$. The matching upper bound was proved by Alon and Freiman [AlFr88].

Erdős Problem 771 (Erdős–Graham + Alon–Freiman [AlFr88]):
$f(n) = (\tfrac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot n / \log n$.

Formally: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$,
$$(\tfrac{1}{2} - \varepsilon) \cdot n / \log n \leq f(n) \leq (\tfrac{1}{2} + \varepsilon) \cdot n / \log n.$$
