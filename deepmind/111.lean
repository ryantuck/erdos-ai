A graph $G$ (on vertex type $V$) has chromatic number $\aleph_1$ if it cannot be properly
colored with countably many colors but can be properly colored with $\aleph_1$ colors.

For a graph $G$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $h(G, n)$ is defined as the maximum over all $n$-vertex
induced subgraphs $H$ of $G$ of the minimum number of edges that must be deleted
from $H$ to make it bipartite.

That is, $h(G, n)$ is the smallest $k$ such that every induced subgraph of $G$ on
exactly $n$ vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most $k$ edges.

/--
There exists a graph $G$ with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ such that
$h(G, n) \ll n^{1+\varepsilon}$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$.

- For every $G$ with chromatic number $\aleph_1$, $h(G, n) \gg n$, since $G$ must
  contain $\aleph_1$ many vertex-disjoint odd cycles of some fixed length $2r+1$.
- Erdős–Hajnal–Szemerédi [EHS82] proved there exists $G$ with chromatic number
  $\aleph_1$ satisfying $h(G, n) \ll n^{3/2}$.
- Erdős [Er81] conjectured this upper bound can be improved: there should exist $G$
  with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ such that $h(G, n) \ll n^{1+\varepsilon}$ for
  every $\varepsilon > 0$.
