# Erdős Problem 675

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/675](https://www.erdosproblems.com/675)

We say that $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ has the translation property if, for every $n$, there exists
some integer $t_n \geq 1$ such that, for all $1 \leq a \leq n$,
$a \in A$ if and only if $a + t_n \in A$.

Three questions:
1. Does the set of sums of two squares have the translation property?
2. If we partition all primes into $P \sqcup Q$, such that each set contains $\gg x/\log x$
   many primes $\leq x$ for all large $x$, then can the set of integers only divisible
   by primes from $P$ have the translation property?
3. If $A$ is the set of squarefree numbers then how fast does the minimal such $t_n$
   grow? Is it true that $t_n > \exp(n^c)$ for some constant $c > 0$?

Elementary sieve theory implies the set of squarefree numbers has the
translation property.

Erdős Problem 675, Part 2 [Er79]:

If we partition all primes into $P \sqcup Q$, such that each set contains $\gg x/\log x$
many primes $\leq x$ for all large $x$, then can the set of integers only divisible
by primes from $P$ have the translation property?

Formalized as: for any such partition, the $P$-smooth numbers do NOT have
the translation property.

Erdős Problem 675, Part 3 [Er79]:

If $A$ is the set of squarefree numbers, then the minimal translation $t_n$
grows faster than $\exp(n^c)$ for some constant $c > 0$. That is, there exists
$c > 0$ and $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$, $t_n > \exp(n^c)$.
