# Erdős Problem 783

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/783](https://www.erdosproblems.com/783)

Fix some constant $C > 0$ and let $N$ be large. Let $A \subseteq \{2, \ldots, N\}$ be such that
$(a, b) = 1$ for all $a \neq b \in A$ and $\sum_{n \in A} 1/n \leq C$.

What choice of such an $A$ minimises the number of integers $m \leq N$ not divisible
by any $a \in A$?

Erdős suggests the optimal set is consecutive largest primes up to $N$.
Tao conjectures the minimum is $(\rho(e^C) + o(1))N$ where $\rho$ is the Dickman function.

Erdős Problem 783 (Tao's formulation):

For any $C > 0$, the minimum number of integers in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ not divisible by
any element of a pairwise coprime set $A \subseteq \{2, \ldots, N\}$ with
$\sum_{a \in A} 1/a \leq C$ is asymptotically $\rho(e^C) \cdot N$, where $\rho$ is the
Dickman function.

That is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and large enough $N$:
(1) There exists a valid $A$ with unsieved count $\leq (\rho(e^C) + \varepsilon) \cdot N$.
(2) Every valid $A$ has unsieved count $\geq (\rho(e^C) - \varepsilon) \cdot N$.
