# Erdős Problem 240

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/240](https://www.erdosproblems.com/240)

Is there an infinite set of primes $P$ such that if $\{a_1 < a_2 < \cdots\}$ is the set of
positive integers divisible only by primes in $P$, then $\lim(a_{i+1} - a_i) = \infty$?

Originally asked to Erdős by Wintner. The answer is yes for finite sets of primes,
which follows from a theorem of Pólya [Po18].

Tijdeman [Ti73] resolved this question, proving that for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists
an infinite set of primes $P$ such that $a_{i+1} - a_i \gg a_i^{1-\varepsilon}$.

Erdős Problem 240 [Er61, Er65b]:
There exists an infinite set of primes $P$ such that if $\{a_1 < a_2 < \cdots\}$ is the
set of positive integers divisible only by primes in $P$ (the $P$-smooth numbers),
then the consecutive gaps $a_{i+1} - a_i$ tend to infinity.

Equivalently: for every bound $B$, only finitely many $P$-smooth numbers $n$ have
another $P$-smooth number within distance $B$ above them.

Proved by Tijdeman [Ti73].
