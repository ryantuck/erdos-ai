Erdős Problem 1018 [Er71]:

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C$ (depending on $\varepsilon$) and a
threshold $N_0$ such that, for all $n \ge N_0$, every simple graph on $n$ vertices with at
least $\lceil n^{1+\varepsilon} \rceil$ edges contains an induced subgraph on at most $C$ vertices
which is non-planar.

Solved by Kostochka and Pyber [KoPy88].
