A positive integer $k$ is representable as a sum of distinct unit fractions with
denominators from $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ if there exists a subset $S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ such
that $\sum_{n \in S} 1/n = k$.

Erdős Problem 309 (disproved) [ErGr80]:

Let $N \geq 1$. How many integers can be written as the sum of distinct unit fractions
with denominators from $\{1, \ldots, N\}$? Erdős conjectured that there are $o(\log N)$ such
integers. This was disproved.

The trivial upper bound is $F(N) \leq \log N + O(1)$. Yokota [Yo97] proved that
$F(N) \geq \log N - O(\log \log N)$, establishing that $F(N) = \Theta(\log N)$.

We formalize the negation of the original conjecture: there exists a positive
constant $c$ such that $F(N) \geq c \cdot \log N$ for all sufficiently large $N$.
