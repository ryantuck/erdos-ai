Bollobás-Erdős conjecture (proved by Edwards [Ed78]):
If $G$ is a graph with $n$ vertices and more than $n^2/4$ edges, then $G$ contains a
triangle on vertices $x, y, z$ such that $d(x) + d(y) + d(z) \geq 3n/2$.

theorem erdos_904 :
    ∀ (n : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
      (n : ℝ) ^ 2 / 4 < (G.edgeFinset.card : ℝ) →
      ∃ x y z : Fin n, G.Adj x y ∧ G.Adj y z ∧ G.Adj x z ∧
        (G.degree x + G.degree y + G.degree z : ℝ) ≥ 3 / 2 * (n : ℝ) := by
