# Erdős Problem 836

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/836](https://www.erdosproblems.com/836)

Let $r \geq 2$ and $G$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number 3
(that is, there is a 3-colouring of the vertices of $G$ such that no edge
is monochromatic). Suppose any two edges of $G$ have a non-empty intersection.

Must $G$ contain $O(r^2)$ many vertices?
Must there be two edges which meet in $\gg r$ many vertices?

A problem of Erdős and Shelah [Er74d].

Alon showed the first question is false: there exists an intersecting
$r$-uniform 3-chromatic hypergraph with $\sim 4^r / \sqrt{r}$ vertices.

Erdős and Lovász [ErLo75] proved that there must be two edges meeting
in $\Omega(r / \log r)$ vertices. The second question ($\Omega(r)$) remains open.

Erdős Problem 836 [Er74d]:

For every $r$-uniform intersecting hypergraph with chromatic number 3,
there exist two edges meeting in $\Omega(r)$ vertices.

Formally: there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for all $r \geq 2$ and for every
such hypergraph, there exist two distinct edges whose intersection has
size $\geq C \cdot r$.

Erdős and Lovász [ErLo75] proved the weaker bound $\Omega(r / \log r)$.
