# Erdős Problem 722

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/722](https://www.erdosproblems.com/722)

Let $k > r$ and $n$ be sufficiently large in terms of $k$ and $r$. Does there always
exist a Steiner system $S(r, k, n)$, provided the trivial necessary divisibility
conditions $\binom{k-i}{r-i} \mid \binom{n-i}{r-i}$ are satisfied for every $0 \le i < r$?

That is, can one find a family of $\binom{n}{k}/\binom{k}{r}$ many $k$-element subsets of
$\{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that every $r$-element subset is contained in exactly one set
in the family?

This was proved for $(r,k)$ by:
- Kirkman for $(2,3)$;
- Hanani [Ha61] for $(3,4)$, $(2,4)$, and $(2,5)$;
- Wilson [Wi72] for $(2,k)$ for any $k$;
- Keevash [Ke14] for all $(r,k)$.

Erdős Problem 722 (Keevash's theorem [Ke14]):

For every $k > r \ge 1$, there exists $N_0$ such that for all $n \ge N_0$, if the
necessary divisibility conditions are satisfied, then a Steiner system
$S(r, k, n)$ exists.
