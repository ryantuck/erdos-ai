# Erdős Problem 880

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/880](https://www.erdosproblems.com/880)

Let $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ be an additive basis of order $k$. Let
$B = \{b_1 < b_2 < \cdots\}$ be the set of integers which are the sum of $k$ or fewer
distinct $a \in A$. Is it true that $b_{n+1} - b_n = O(1)$?

A problem of Burr and Erdős [Er98]. Hegyvári, Hennecart, and Plagne [HHP07] showed the
answer is yes for $k = 2$ (in fact with $b_{n+1} - b_n \leq 2$ for sufficiently large $n$)
but no for $k \geq 3$.

Erdős Problem 880 (Hegyvári–Hennecart–Plagne [HHP07]):

If $A$ is an additive basis of order $2$, then the distinct sum set $B$ of $A$ (sums of
at most $2$ distinct elements) has gaps bounded by $2$ for all sufficiently large
elements: for large enough $b \in B$, the next element of $B$ is at most $b + 2$.

Erdős Problem 880, counterexample for $k \geq 3$ (Hegyvári–Hennecart–Plagne [HHP07]):

For every $k \geq 3$, there exists an additive basis $A$ of order $k$ whose distinct sum
set has unbounded gaps.
