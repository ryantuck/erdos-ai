# Erdős Problem 854

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/854](https://www.erdosproblems.com/854)

Let $n_k$ denote the $k$-th primorial, i.e. the product of the first $k$ primes.
If $1 = a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_{\varphi(n_k)} = n_k - 1$ is the sequence of integers
coprime to $n_k$, are there $\gg \max_i (a_{i+1} - a_i)$ many even integers
of the form $a_{j+1} - a_j$?

This was asked by Erdős in Oberwolfach (most likely in 1986) [Er85c, Ob1].

Erdős Problem 854 [Er85c, Ob1]:

Let $n_k$ be the $k$-th primorial. The number of distinct even integers appearing
as consecutive gaps among integers coprime to $n_k$ in $\{1, \ldots, n_k - 1\}$
is $\gg \max_i(a_{i+1} - a_i)$. That is, there exist $C > 0$ and $K_0$ such that for all
$k \geq K_0$, the number of distinct gap values is at least $C$ times the maximum gap.
