# Erdős Problem 635

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/635](https://www.erdosproblems.com/635)

Let $t \geq 1$ and $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ be such that whenever $a, b \in A$ with
$b - a \geq t$ we have $(b - a) \nmid b$. How large can $|A|$ be? Is it true that
$|A| \leq (1/2 + o(1)) \cdot N$?

Asked by Erdős in a letter to Ruzsa around 1980.

[Gu83] Guy, R. K., _Unsolved Problems in Number Theory_ (1983).

[Ru99] Ruzsa, I., related correspondence and results (1999).

When $t = 1$, the maximum is $\lfloor (N+1)/2 \rfloor$, achieved by taking $A$ to be all odd
numbers in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$. When $t = 2$, Erdős observed $|A| \geq N/2 + c \log N$ for
some $c > 0$, by taking $A$ to be the odd numbers together with $2^k$ for odd $k$.

The upper bound $|A| \leq (1/2 + o(1)) \cdot N$ has been resolved affirmatively.

When $t = 1$, the maximum size of a divisibility-avoidance set in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$
is exactly $\lfloor (N+1)/2 \rfloor$, achieved by taking all odd numbers. [Gu83][Ru99]

When $t = 2$, there exists $c > 0$ such that there is a set $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$
satisfying the divisibility-avoidance condition with $|A| \geq N/2 + c \cdot \log N$.
(Take $A$ to be the odd numbers together with $2^k$ for odd $k$.) [Gu83][Ru99]

/--
For every $t \geq 1$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N_0$ such that for all $N \geq N_0$,
every $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ satisfying the divisibility-avoidance property with
threshold $t$ has $|A| \leq (1/2 + \varepsilon) \cdot N$. [Gu83][Ru99]

Equivalently, $\mathrm{maxDivAvoidance}(N, t) / N \to 1/2$ as $N \to \infty$ for any fixed $t$.
