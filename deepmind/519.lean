# Erdős Problem 519

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/519](https://www.erdosproblems.com/519)

A problem of Turán, who proved that the maximum is $\gg 1/n$. This was solved
by Atkinson [At61b], who showed that $c = 1/6$ suffices. This has been improved
by Biró, first to $c = 1/2$ [Bi94], and later to an absolute constant $c > 1/2$
[Bi00].

Erdős Problem 519 (Turán's power sum problem) [At61b]:

There exists an absolute constant $c > 0$ such that for any $n \geq 1$ and any complex
numbers $z_1, \ldots, z_n$ with $z_1 = 1$,
$$\max_{1 \leq k \leq n} \left| \sum_i z_i^k \right| > c.$$
