A choice of residue classes for primes $p \le x$ covers $[1, y]$ if every
integer $n \in \{1, \ldots, y\}$ is congruent to $a(p) \pmod{p}$ for some prime $p \le x$.
This captures the covering system used in the Jacobsthal function.

def PrimeCovering (x y : ℕ) (a : ℕ → ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ n : ℕ, 1 ≤ n → n ≤ y → ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ p ≤ x ∧ n % p = a p % p

Erdős Problem 687 (weak form): $Y(x) = o(x^2)$.
Let $Y(x)$ be the maximal $y$ such that there exists a choice of congruence
classes $a_p$ for all primes $p \le x$ such that every integer in $[1, y]$ is
congruent to at least one of the $a_p \pmod{p}$. Then $Y(x) = o(x^2)$.

theorem erdos_687 :
    ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ X : ℕ, ∀ x : ℕ, x ≥ X →
    ∀ (a : ℕ → ℕ) (y : ℕ), PrimeCovering x y a →

/--
Erdős Problem 687 (strong form): $Y(x) \ll x^{1+o(1)}$.
For every $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $x$, any covering of $[1, y]$
by residue classes of primes $\le x$ satisfies $y \le x^{1+\varepsilon}$.
