# Erdős Problem 1057

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1057](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1057)

Let $C(x)$ count the number of Carmichael numbers in $[1, x]$. Is it true that
$C(x) = x^{1-o(1)}$?

A Carmichael number is a composite $n > 1$ such that $a^n \equiv a \pmod{n}$ for all $a$.
By Korselt's criterion, this is equivalent to $n$ being squarefree, composite,
and $p - 1 \mid n - 1$ for all primes $p \mid n$.

Alford, Granville, and Pomerance [AGP94] proved $C(x) \to \infty$ and $C(x) > x^{2/7}$.
Harman [Ha08] improved the lower bound to $C(x) > x^{0.33336704}$.

$n$ is squarefree, and $p - 1 \mid n - 1$ for every prime $p$ dividing $n$.

Erdős Problem 1057 [Er56c]:

Is it true that $C(x) = x^{1-o(1)}$? That is, does $\log C(x) / \log x \to 1$
as $x \to \infty$?

This asks whether the Carmichael counting function grows almost as fast
as $x$ itself, in the sense that the exponent approaches 1.
