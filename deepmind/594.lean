# Erdős Problem 594

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/594](https://www.erdosproblems.com/594)

A problem of Erdős and Hajnal: does every graph with chromatic number
$\geq \aleph_1$ contain all sufficiently large odd cycles? Proved by
Erdős, Hajnal, and Shelah [EHS74].

Erdős Problem 594 [ErHa66] [Er69b]:

Every graph with uncountable chromatic number (i.e., chromatic number
$\geq \aleph_1$) contains all sufficiently large odd cycles. That is, there exists
$N_0$ such that for all odd $n \geq N_0$ (with $n \geq 3$), the graph contains $C_n$
as a subgraph.

Proved by Erdős, Hajnal, and Shelah [EHS74].
