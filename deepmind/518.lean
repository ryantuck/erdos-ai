# Erdős Problem 518

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/518](https://www.erdosproblems.com/518)

A problem of Erdős and Gyárfás [ErGy95]. Gerencsér and Gyárfás [GeGy67]
proved that, if the paths do not need to be of the same colour, then two
paths suffice. Erdős and Gyárfás proved that $2\sqrt{n}$ paths suffice and
observed that $\sqrt{n}$ would be best possible.

Solved in the affirmative by Pokrovskiy, Versteegen, and Williams [PVW24].

    consecutive pair of vertices in the path receives color $b$. A path
    of length $\leq 1$ is trivially monochromatic. -/

Erdős Problem 518 [ErGy95]:

Is it true that, in any two-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, there exist
at most $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$ monochromatic paths, all of the same colour,
which together cover all vertices?

The bound is formalized as `Nat.sqrt n + 1`, which satisfies
$\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil \leq \text{Nat.sqrt}\; n + 1$ for all $n$.

Solved in the affirmative by Pokrovskiy, Versteegen, and Williams [PVW24].
