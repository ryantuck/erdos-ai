# Erdős Problem 500

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/500](https://www.erdosproblems.com/500)

What is $\mathrm{ex}_3(n, K_4^3)$? That is, the largest number of $3$-edges which can be placed
on $n$ vertices so that there exists no $K_4^3$, a set of $4$ vertices which is covered
by all $4$ possible $3$-edges.

A problem of Turán. Turán observed that dividing the vertices into three equal
parts $X_1, X_2, X_3$, and taking the edges to be those triples that either have
exactly one vertex in each part or two vertices in $X_i$ and one vertex in $X_{i+1}$
(where $X_4 = X_1$) shows that
$$
  \mathrm{ex}_3(n, K_4^3) \geq (5/9 + o(1)) \binom{n}{3}.
$$
This is probably the truth. The current best upper bound is
$$
  \mathrm{ex}_3(n, K_4^3) \leq 0.5611666 \binom{n}{3},
$$
due to Razborov [Ra10].

Erdős Problem 500 — Turán's Hypergraph Conjecture [Er61][Er71][Er74c][Er81]:

The $3$-uniform Turán density for $K_4^3$ is exactly $5/9$. Equivalently,
$$
  \mathrm{ex}_3(n, K_4^3) / \binom{n}{3} \to 5/9 \text{ as } n \to \infty.
$$
Turán conjectured that the lower bound construction (partition into $3$ equal parts,
take triples with one vertex in each part or two in $X_i$ and one in $X_{i+1}$) is
optimal. This remains open. The best known upper bound is $\leq 0.5611666 \binom{n}{3}$
due to Razborov [Ra10].
