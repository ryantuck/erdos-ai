# Erdős Problem 501

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/501](https://www.erdosproblems.com/501)

For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, let $A_x \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded set with outer measure
$< 1$. Must there exist an infinite independent set, that is, some infinite $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
such that $x \notin A_y$ for all $x \neq y \in X$?

If the sets $A_x$ are closed and have measure $< 1$, then must there exist an
independent set of size $3$?

Erdős and Hajnal proved the existence of arbitrarily large finite independent
sets (under the assumptions in the first problem). Hechler showed the answer
to the first question is no, assuming the continuum hypothesis. Newelski,
Pawlikowski, and Seredyński proved that if all the $A_x$ are closed with
measure $< 1$ then there is an infinite independent set.

Erdős Problem 501 [Er61][ErHa71]: If each $A_x$ is bounded with outer measure $< 1$, must
there exist an infinite independent set?

Hechler showed the answer is no assuming the continuum hypothesis. The full
ZFC status remains open.

Erdős Problem 501, closed variant [Er61][ErHa71]: If each $A_x$ is closed with
measure $< 1$, must there exist an independent set of size $3$?

Newelski, Pawlikowski, and Seredyński proved that under these hypotheses there
is in fact an infinite independent set.
