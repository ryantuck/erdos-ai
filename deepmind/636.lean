# Erdős Problem 636

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/636](https://www.erdosproblems.com/636)

Suppose $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices which contains no complete graph or independent
set on $\gg \log n$ many vertices. Must $G$ contain $\gg n^{5/2}$ induced subgraphs which
pairwise differ in either the number of vertices or the number of edges?

A problem of Erdős, Faudree, and Sós [Er93, p.346], who proved there exist
$\gg n^{3/2}$ many such subgraphs, and note that $n^{5/2}$ would be best possible.

This was proved by Kwan and Sudakov [KwSu21].

**Erdős Problem 636** [Er93, p.346][Er97d]:

For every $C > 0$, there exist $c > 0$ and $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$, if $G$ is a
graph on $n$ vertices with clique number at most $C \cdot \log_2(n)$ and independence number
at most $C \cdot \log_2(n)$, then $G$ has at least $c \cdot n^{5/2}$ distinct induced subgraph
signatures (pairs (vertex count, edge count) among all induced subgraphs of $G$).

Proved by Kwan and Sudakov [KwSu21].
