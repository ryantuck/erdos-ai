# Erdős Problem 614

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/614](https://www.erdosproblems.com/614)

Let $f(n,k)$ be minimal such that there is a graph with $n$ vertices and $f(n,k)$ edges
where every set of $k+2$ vertices induces a subgraph with maximum degree at least $k$.
Determine $f(n,k)$.

A problem of Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp.

/-- A graph $G$ on `Fin n` has the **$(n,k)$-induced degree property** if every subset of
exactly $k + 2$ vertices contains a vertex adjacent to at least $k$ other vertices
in the subset (i.e., the induced subgraph on that subset has maximum degree $\geq k$). -/

/-- `erdos614_f n k` is the minimum number of edges in a graph on $n$ vertices such that
every subset of $k + 2$ vertices induces a subgraph with maximum degree at least $k$.
This is the function $f(n, k)$ from Erdős Problem 614. -/

**Erdős Problem 614** [FRS97]:

For $n \geq k + 2$, the function $f(n, k)$ is well-defined. The complete graph on $n$ vertices
witnesses this: every $(k+2)$-element induced subgraph is $K_{k+2}$ with maximum degree
$k+1 \geq k$. The problem asks to determine the exact value of $f(n, k)$.
