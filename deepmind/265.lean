Erdős Problem #265 [ErGr80, p.64] [Er88c, p.104]:

Let $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ be a strictly increasing sequence of integers with
$a_n \ge 2$ for all $n$. If both $\sum 1/a_n$ and $\sum 1/(a_n - 1)$ are rational, then
$a_n^{1/2^n} \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$.

Cantor observed that $a_n = \binom{n}{2}$ is such a sequence. Erdős believed that
$a_n^{1/n} \to \infty$ is possible (proved by Kovač–Tao [KoTa24]) but that
$a_n^{1/2^n} \to 1$ is necessary (still open). A folklore result establishes
that $\sum 1/a_n$ is irrational whenever $a_n^{1/2^n} \to \infty$, so such a sequence
cannot grow faster than doubly exponentially. The remaining question is the
precise exponent possible.
