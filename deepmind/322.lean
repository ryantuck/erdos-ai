# Erdős Problem 322

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/322](https://www.erdosproblems.com/322)

Let $k \geq 3$ and let $A$ be the set of $k$-th powers. Define $1_A^{(k)}(n)$ as
the number of representations of $n$ as the sum of $k$ many $k$-th powers,
i.e., the number of tuples $(a_1, \ldots, a_k) \in \mathbb{N}^k$ with
$a_1^k + \cdots + a_k^k = n$.

The conjecture asks: for each $k \geq 3$, does there exist some $c > 0$ and
infinitely many $n$ such that $1_A^{(k)}(n) > n^c$?

Connected to Waring's problem. The famous Hypothesis K of Hardy and Littlewood
asserted $1_A^{(k)}(n) \leq n^{o(1)}$, which was disproved by Mahler for $k = 3$,
who showed $1_A^{(3)}(n) \gg n^{1/12}$ for infinitely many $n$. Erdős believed
Hypothesis K fails for all $k \geq 4$, but this remains unknown.

/-- The number of representations of $n$ as a sum of $k$ many $k$-th powers of
natural numbers: $|\{(a_1, \ldots, a_k) \in \mathbb{N}^k : a_1^k + \cdots + a_k^k = n\}|$.
Each component $a_i$ is bounded by $n$ since $a_i^k \leq n$ for $k \geq 1$. -/

**Erdős Problem 322**: For every $k \geq 3$, there exists $c > 0$ such that
the number of representations of $n$ as a sum of $k$ many $k$-th powers
exceeds $n^c$ for infinitely many $n$.
