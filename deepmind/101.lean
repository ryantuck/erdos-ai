A finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has no five collinear points if every five-element subset
is not collinear (i.e., no line contains five or more of the points).

  ∀ S : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)),
    S ⊆ P → S.card = 5 → ¬Collinear ℝ (S : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)))

The number of $4$-rich lines: the number of distinct affine lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that
contain at least four points from $P$.

An affine line is a $1$-dimensional affine subspace (`Module.finrank` of its
direction submodule equals $1$).

Erdős Problem #101: Given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, no five of which are collinear,
the number of lines containing at least four of the points is $o(n^2)$.

Formally: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$ and every
set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no five collinear, the count of $4$-rich lines
is at most $\varepsilon \cdot n^2$.

theorem erdos_101 :
    ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 →
      ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ N →
        ∀ P : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)),
          P.card = n →
          NoFiveCollinear P →
