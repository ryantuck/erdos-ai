# Erdős Problem 921

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/921](https://www.erdosproblems.com/921)

Let $k \geq 4$ and let $f_k(n)$ be the largest $m$ such that there is a graph on $n$
vertices with chromatic number $k$ in which every odd cycle has length $> m$.
Is it true that $f_k(n) \asymp n^{1/(k-2)}$?

A question of Erdős and Gallai [Er69b]. Gallai proved that $f_4(n) \gg n^{1/2}$
and Erdős (unpublished) proved $f_4(n) \ll n^{1/2}$.

This was proved for all $k \geq 4$ by Kierstead, Szemerédi, and Trotter [KST84].

Erdős Problem 921, lower bound [Er69b] [KST84]:

For every $k \geq 4$, there exist $C > 0$ and $N_0$ such that for all $n \geq N_0$,
$f_k(n) \geq C \cdot n^{1/(k-2)}$.
