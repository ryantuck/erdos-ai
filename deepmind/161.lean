Erdős Conjecture (Problem 161) [Er90b, p.21]:

For any $t \geq 2$ and $0 < \alpha < 1/2$, the function $F^{(t)}(n, \alpha)$ is bounded by a
polynomial in $\log n$. Specifically, there exist constants $C > 0$ and $D > 0$
(depending on $t$ and $\alpha$) such that $F^{(t)}(n, \alpha) \leq C \cdot (\log n)^D$ for all
sufficiently large $n$.

This captures Erdős's conjecture that "the jump occurs all in one step at $0$":
for $\alpha > 0$, $F^{(t)}(n, \alpha)$ grows polynomially in $\log n$, contrasting with the
much slower iterated-logarithm growth $F^{(t)}(n, 0) \approx \log_{t-1}(n)$.
