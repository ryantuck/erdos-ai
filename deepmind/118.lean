Erdős–Hajnal Conjecture on Partition Ordinals (Problem 118)
[Er87, Er90, Er95d, Er97f] — **DISPROVED**

An ordinal $\alpha$ is called a *partition ordinal* if $\alpha \to (\alpha, 3)^2$, i.e., every
$2$-coloring of pairs from a linearly ordered set of order type $\alpha$ contains either
a monochromatic copy of $\alpha$ in color $0$ (red) or a monochromatic triangle $K_3$ in
color $1$ (blue).

Erdős and Hajnal conjectured that for every partition ordinal $\alpha$ and every $n \geq 3$,
we also have $\alpha \to (\alpha, n)^2$.

This conjecture is FALSE, as independently shown by Schipperus [Sc99] (published in
[Sc10]) and Darby [Da99]. For example, Larson [La00] showed that $\omega^{\omega^2}$ is a
partition ordinal — i.e., $\omega^{\omega^2} \to (\omega^{\omega^2}, 3)^2$ holds — but
$\omega^{\omega^2} \to (\omega^{\omega^2}, 5)^2$ fails.

See also Hajnal–Larson, Chapter 2.9 of [HST10] for background and proof sketches.
