    exists an edge coloring using $n$ colors such that every 4-cycle in the

**Erdős Problem 810**: Does there exist some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that, for all
sufficiently large $n$, there exists a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with at least
$\varepsilon n^2$ many edges such that the edges can be coloured with $n$ colours so that
every $C_4$ receives 4 distinct colours?
