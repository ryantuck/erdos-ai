Erdős Problem 929 [Er76d]:

For $k \geq 2$, let $S(k)$ be the minimal $x$ such that the set of $n$ with
$n+1, \ldots, n+k$ all $x$-smooth has positive upper density. The conjecture is that
$S(k) \geq k^{1-o(1)}$, i.e., for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and all sufficiently large $k$,
if $x < k^{1-\varepsilon}$ then the set of $n$ with $n+1, \ldots, n+k$ all $x$-smooth does not
have positive upper density.
