# Erdős Problem 756

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/756](https://www.erdosproblems.com/756)

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points. Can there be $\gg n$ many
distinct distances each of which occurs for more than $n$ many pairs from $A$?

Erdős Problem 756 [ErPa90, Er97b] (proved by Bhowmick [Bh24]):
There exists a constant $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
there is a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the number of
distinct distances occurring more than $n$ times (as ordered pairs) being
at least $c \cdot n$.
