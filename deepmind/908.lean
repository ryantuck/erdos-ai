Erdős Problem 908 (proved by Laczkovich [La80]):

Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that for every $h > 0$, the function
$x \mapsto f(x + h) - f(x)$ is measurable. Is it true that $f = g + \varphi + r$ where
$g$ is continuous, $\varphi$ is additive (i.e., $\varphi(x + y) = \varphi(x) + \varphi(y)$),
and $r(x + h) - r(x) = 0$ for every $h$ and almost all (depending on $h$) $x$?

A conjecture of de Bruijn and Erdős. Answered in the affirmative by Laczkovich.
See also [907].
