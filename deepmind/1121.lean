Erdős Problem #1121 (proved by Goodman and Goodman [GoGo45]):

If $C_1, \ldots, C_n$ are circles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with radii $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ such that no
line disjoint from all the circles divides them into two non-empty sets, then the circles can be
covered by a circle of radius $r = \sum r_i$.

A line in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is parameterized by a unit normal vector $v$ and offset $d$, defining
$\ell = \{x : \langle x, v \rangle = d\}$. The closed disk $\bar{B}(c_i, r_i)$ is disjoint from
$\ell$ when $|\langle c_i, v \rangle - d| > r_i$. The non-separability condition says that whenever
all disks are disjoint from a line, they all lie on the same side.
