Erdős Problem 365 [Er76d, p. 31] [ErGr80, p. 68]:

Do all pairs of consecutive powerful numbers $n$ and $n+1$ come from solutions to
Pell equations? In other words, must either $n$ or $n+1$ be a square?

Is the number of such $n \leq x$ bounded by $(\log x)^{O(1)}$?

The first question was answered negatively by Golomb [Go70], who observed that
$12167 = 23^3$ and $12168 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 13^2$ are both powerful (neither is a square).
Walker [Wa76] proved that $7^3 x^2 = 3^3 y^2 + 1$ has infinitely many solutions,
giving infinitely many counterexamples.

The second question remains open. We formalize it: there exists $C > 0$ such that
for all sufficiently large $x$, the number of $n \leq x$ with both $n$ and $n+1$ powerful
is at most $(\log x)^C$.
