# Erdős Problem 815

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/815](https://www.erdosproblems.com/815)

Let $k \geq 3$ and $n$ be sufficiently large. Is it true that if $G$ is a graph
with $n$ vertices and $2n - 2$ edges such that every proper induced subgraph has
minimum degree $\leq 2$ then $G$ must contain a copy of $C_k$?

Such graphs are called *degree 3 critical*. This conjecture was **disproved** by
Narins, Pokrovskiy, and Szabó [NPS17], who proved that there exist arbitrarily
large such graphs with no cycle of length $23$.

It remains open whether the answer is affirmative when restricted to even $k$.
