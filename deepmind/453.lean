# Erdős Problem 453

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/453](https://www.erdosproblems.com/453)

Is it true that, for all sufficiently large $n$, there exists some $i < n$ such that
$p_n^2 < p_{n+i} \cdot p_{n-i}$, where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime?

Asked by Erdős and Straus. Selfridge conjectured the answer is no, contrary
to Erdős and Straus. The answer is no, as shown by Pomerance [Po79], who
proved there are infinitely many $n$ such that $p_n^2 > p_{n+i} \cdot p_{n-i}$
for all $0 < i < n$.

Erdős Problem 453 (Disproved by Pomerance [Po79]):

There are infinitely many $n$ such that $p_n^2 > p_{n+i} \cdot p_{n-i}$ for all
$0 < i < n$, where $p_k$ denotes the $k$th prime (0-indexed).

This disproves the conjecture of Erdős and Straus that for all sufficiently
large $n$ there exists $i < n$ with $p_n^2 < p_{n+i} \cdot p_{n-i}$.
