# Erdős Problem 666

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/666](https://www.erdosproblems.com/666)

Let $Q_n$ be the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph (so that $Q_n$ has $2^n$ vertices
and $n \cdot 2^{n-1}$ edges). Is it true that, for every $\epsilon > 0$, if $n$ is
sufficiently large, every subgraph of $Q_n$ with $\geq \epsilon \cdot n \cdot 2^{n-1}$
many edges contains a $C_6$?

The answer is no: Chung [Ch92] and Brouwer, Dejter, and Thomassen [BDT93] constructed
an edge-partition of $Q_n$ into four subgraphs, each containing no $C_6$.

Erdős Problem 666 (disproved) [Er91][Er92b][Er97f]:

The original conjecture asked whether for every $\epsilon > 0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large,
every subgraph of $Q_n$ with $\geq \epsilon \cdot n \cdot 2^{n-1}$ edges contains a $C_6$.

This is false. Chung [Ch92] and Brouwer, Dejter, and Thomassen [BDT93] constructed
an edge-partition of $Q_n$ into four subgraphs, each containing no $C_6$.

Formalized as the negation: there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that for all $n \geq 1$, there is a
subgraph of $Q_n$ with at least $\epsilon \cdot n \cdot 2^{n-1}$ edges that contains no $C_6$.
