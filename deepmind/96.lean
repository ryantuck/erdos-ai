A finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is in convex position if no point lies in the
convex hull of the remaining points. Equivalently, the points are the vertices
of a convex polygon.

The number of ordered pairs of distinct points in $P$ that are at unit distance.
(Using ordered pairs; the number of unordered pairs is exactly half this,
so the $O(n)$ bound is equivalent.)

Erdős Problem 96 (Erdős–Moser conjecture):
If $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a convex polygon (are in convex position), then there
are $O(n)$ many pairs which are distance $1$ apart.

Formally: there exists an absolute constant $C > 0$ such that for every finite
set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in convex position, the number of (ordered) pairs at
unit distance is at most $C \cdot |P|$.

theorem erdos_96 :
    ∃ C : ℝ, C > 0 ∧
    ∀ (P : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))),
      ConvexPosition P →
      (unitDistancePairCount P : ℝ) ≤ C * (P.card : ℝ) := by
