Does there exist a constant $C > 1$ such that, for every $n \geq 2$, there
exists a sequence $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{C}$ with $z_1 = 1$ and
$|z_i| \geq 1$ for all $i$, such that
$$\max_{2 \leq k \leq n+1} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i^k \right| < C^{-n}?$$

A problem of Erdős [Er65b, p.213]. See also [519].
