Erdős-Füredi-Loebl-Sós Conjecture (Problem 580):
Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices such that at least $n/2$ vertices have degree at
least $n/2$. Must $G$ contain every tree on at most $n/2$ vertices?

Conjectured by Erdős, Füredi, Loebl, and Sós [EFLS95].
Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi [AKS95] proved an asymptotic version.
Zhao [Zh11] proved the conjecture for all sufficiently large $n$.
