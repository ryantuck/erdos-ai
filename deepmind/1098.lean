Erdős Problem 1098 (Proved by Neumann [Ne76]):
Let $G$ be a group and $\Gamma(G)$ be the non-commuting graph, with vertices the elements
of $G$ and an edge between $g$ and $h$ if and only if $gh \neq hg$. If $\Gamma$ contains no
infinite complete subgraph (i.e., no infinite set of pairwise non-commuting
elements), then there is a finite bound on the size of complete subgraphs of $\Gamma$.

Neumann proved that $\Gamma$ contains no infinite complete subgraph if and only if
the centre of $G$ has finite index, and if the centre has index $n$ then $\Gamma$
contains no complete subgraph on more than $n$ vertices.
