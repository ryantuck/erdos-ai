Erdős Problem 1111 [ElEr85]:

If $t, c \geq 1$ then there exists $d \geq 1$ such that if $G$ is a finite graph with
$\chi(G) \geq d$ and $\omega(G) < t$, then there exist anticomplete sets
$A, B \subseteq V(G)$ with $\chi(G[A]) \geq c$ and $\chi(G[B]) \geq c$.

Two disjoint vertex sets $A$, $B$ are anticomplete if there are no edges between them.
$\chi$ denotes the chromatic number and $\omega$ the clique number. The condition
$\omega(G) < t$ is expressed as `G.CliqueFree t` (no clique of size $t$ exists).

El Zahar and Erdős show it suffices to consider $t \leq c$. Let $d(t,c)$ be the minimal
such $d$. Known bounds include $d(t,2) \leq \binom{t}{2}+1$ (via Wagon [Wa80b]) and
$d(3,3) \leq 8$.
