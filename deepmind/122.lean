Erdős Problem #122 [Er97, Er97e, EPS97]

For which number-theoretic functions $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is it true that for any
positive function $F : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(n)/F(n) \to 0$ for almost all $n$
(in the natural density sense), there are infinitely many $x$ for which
$$\#\{n \in \mathbb{N} : n + f(n) \in (x, x + F(x))\} / F(x) \to \infty?$$

Erdős, Pomerance, and Sárközy [EPS97] proved that this holds when:
- $f(n) = \tau(n)$ = number of divisors of $n$, and
- $f(n) = \omega(n)$ = number of distinct prime divisors of $n$.

Erdős believed the property to be FALSE for:
- $f(n) = \varphi(n)$ (Euler's totient function), and
- $f(n) = \sigma(n)$ (sum of divisors).

The full characterization of which $f$ satisfy `HasErdos122Property` remains open.
The theorem below records the two proved instances.
