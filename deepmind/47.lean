# Erdős Problem 47

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/47](https://www.erdosproblems.com/47)

Bloom [Bl21] proved that the weaker threshold
$\sum \frac{1}{n} \gg \frac{\log \log \log N}{\log \log N} \cdot \log N$ suffices,
which implies the conjecture below.

If $\delta > 0$ and $N$ is sufficiently large (depending on $\delta$), and
$A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ is such that
$$\sum_{a \in A} \frac{1}{a} > \delta \cdot \log N,$$
then there exists a nonempty subset $S \subseteq A$ such that
$$\sum_{n \in S} \frac{1}{n} = 1.$$

Proved by Bloom [Bl21], who showed the weaker threshold
$\sum \frac{1}{n} \gg \frac{\log \log \log N}{\log \log N} \cdot \log N$ suffices.

theorem erdos_47 (δ : ℝ) (hδ : δ > 0) :
    ∃ N₀ : ℕ, ∀ N : ℕ, N ≥ N₀ →
