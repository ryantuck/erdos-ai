A finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is in convex position if no point lies in the
convex hull of the remaining points. Equivalently, the points are the vertices
of a convex polygon.

Erdős Problem 93: If $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a convex polygon, then they
determine at least $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ distinct distances. Proved by Altman [Al63].
