Erdős Problem 871 (DISPROVED) [ErNa88]:

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be an additive basis of order $2$, and suppose
$1_A * 1_A(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ (i.e., the number of representations
of $n$ as a sum of two elements of $A$ tends to infinity). Can $A$ be partitioned
into two disjoint additive bases of order $2$?

Erdős and Nathanson proved this is true if $1_A * 1_A(n) > c \log n$ for some
$c > (\log(4/3))^{-1}$. They also proved [ErNa89] that for every $t$ there exists
a basis $A$ of order $2$ with $1_A * 1_A(n) \geq t$ for all large $n$ that cannot
be partitioned into two disjoint additive bases.

Disproved by Larsen using Claude Opus 4.5 — only a small modification of
the argument of [ErNa89] is required.

Formalized as the negation: there exists an additive basis $A$ of order $2$
whose representation function tends to infinity, yet $A$ cannot be partitioned
into two disjoint additive bases of order $2$.
