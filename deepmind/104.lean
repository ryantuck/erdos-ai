The number of distinct unit circles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that contain at least three points
from $P$. A unit circle is uniquely determined by its center (since the radius
is fixed at $1$), so two unit circles are distinct iff they have different centers.

/--
Given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the number of distinct unit circles containing at least
three points is $o(n^2)$.

Formally: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$ and every
set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the number of unit circles (of radius $1$) that each
contain at least $3$ points of $P$ is at most $\varepsilon \cdot n^2$.

theorem erdos_104 :
  ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 →
    ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ N →
      ∀ P : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)),
        P.card = n →
        (threeRichUnitCircleCount P : ℝ) ≤ ε * (n : ℝ) ^ 2 := by
