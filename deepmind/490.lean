# Erdős Problem 490

The products $ab$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ are all distinct: the multiplication
map $A \times B \to \mathbb{N}$ is injective.

def HasDistinctProducts (A B : Finset ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a₁ ∈ A, ∀ b₁ ∈ B, ∀ a₂ ∈ A, ∀ b₂ ∈ B,
    a₁ * b₁ = a₂ * b₂ → a₁ = a₂ ∧ b₁ = b₂

/--
If $A, B \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ are such that all products $ab$ ($a \in A$, $b \in B$)
are distinct, then $|A| \cdot |B| \ll N^2 / \log N$.

Formally: there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for all $N$ and all
$A, B \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ with distinct products,
$$
  |A| \cdot |B| \le C \cdot \frac{N^2}{\log N}.
$$

Proved by Szemerédi [Sz76].
