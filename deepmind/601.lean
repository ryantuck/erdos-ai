# Erdős Problem 601

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/601](https://www.erdosproblems.com/601)

For which limit ordinals $\alpha$ is it true that if $G$ is a graph with vertex set $\alpha$
then $G$ must have either an infinite path or an independent set on a set of
vertices with order type $\alpha$?

A problem of Erdős, Hajnal, and Milner, who proved this is true for
$\alpha < \omega_1^{\omega+2}$. Erdős offered 250 dollars for showing what happens when
$\alpha = \omega_1^{\omega+2}$ and 500 dollars for settling the general case.
Larson proved this is true for all $\alpha < 2^{\aleph_0}$ assuming Martin's axiom.

Erdős Problem 601 [EHM70] [Er81] [Er82e] [Er87]:

Every limit ordinal has the Erdős-Hajnal-Milner property: if $G$ is a graph
with vertex set $\alpha$ (a limit ordinal), then $G$ must have either an infinite path
or an independent set of vertices with order type $\alpha$.

Known results:
- True for $\alpha < \omega_1^{\omega+2}$ (Erdős-Hajnal-Milner, 1970)
- True for all $\alpha < 2^{\aleph_0}$ assuming Martin's axiom (Larson, 1990)
