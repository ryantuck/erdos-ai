A finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has no three collinear if every three-element subset
is not collinear (i.e., no line contains three or more of the points).

Four points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are concyclic if they all lie on a common circle, i.e.,
there exists a center and positive radius such that all four points are
equidistant from the center.

  ∃ c : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2), ∃ r : ℝ, r > 0 ∧ ∀ p ∈ S, dist p c = r

Erdős Problem 98:
Let $h(n)$ be the minimum number of distinct distances determined by any $n$ points
in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no three collinear and no four concyclic. Does $h(n)/n \to \infty$?

Formally: for every $C > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$ and every
set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no three collinear and no four concyclic,
the number of distinct distances is at least $C \cdot n$.
