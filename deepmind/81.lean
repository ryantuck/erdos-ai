An induced cycle of length $k$ in a simple graph $G$: an injective map
$f : \text{Fin}\ k \to V$ such that $f(i)$ and $f(j)$ are adjacent if and only if
$i$ and $j$ are consecutive modulo $k$. This captures the notion that $f$ traces out a
cycle with no chords.

A graph is chordal if it contains no induced cycle of length $\geq 4$.
Equivalently, every cycle of length $\geq 4$ has a chord.

Erdős Problem 81 (Erdős, Ordman, Zalcstein [EOZ93]):

Let $G$ be a chordal graph on $n$ vertices — that is, $G$ has no induced cycles of
length greater than 3. Can the edges of $G$ be partitioned into $n^2/6 + O(n)$
many cliques?

The example of all edges between a complete graph on $n/3$ vertices and an empty
graph on $2n/3$ vertices shows that $n^2/6 + O(n)$ is sometimes necessary.

Formalized as: there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for all $n$ and all
chordal graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exists a collection $P$ of cliques
(vertex sets, each pairwise adjacent in $G$) that partition the edges of $G$,
with $|P| \leq n^2/6 + Cn$.
