Is it true that, for every $k$, there is some $f(k)$ such that if $G$ has chromatic number
$\geq f(k)$ then $G$ contains a triangle-free subgraph with chromatic number $\geq k$?

Proved by Rödl [Ro77]. This is the $r = 4$ special case of problem \#108.
Triangle-free is formalized here as girth $\geq 4$ (no cycles of length 3).

theorem erdos_923 :
    ∀ (k : ℕ), 2 ≤ k →
      ∃ (f : ℕ),
        ∀ (V : Type*) (G : SimpleGraph V),
          (f : ℕ∞) ≤ G.chromaticNumber →
          ∃ H : G.Subgraph,
            (k : ℕ∞) ≤ H.coe.chromaticNumber ∧
            (4 : ℕ∞) ≤ H.coe.egirth := by
