/-- A graph $G$ is $(a,b)$-choosable if for every assignment $L$ of a list of at least $a$
colors to each vertex, there exists a choice of a subset $S(v) \subseteq L(v)$ of size $b$
for each vertex $v$, such that the chosen subsets of adjacent vertices are disjoint. -/

Erdős Problem 632 [ERT80] (disproved by Dvořák, Hu, and Sereni [DHS19]):
If $G$ is $(a,b)$-choosable then $G$ is $(am, bm)$-choosable for every positive integer $m$.
