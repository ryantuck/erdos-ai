Erdős Problem 88 [KSSS22]:
For any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta = \delta(\varepsilon) > 0$ such that if $G$ is a
graph on $n$ vertices with no independent set or clique of size $\geq \varepsilon \log n$ then $G$
contains an induced subgraph with exactly $m$ edges for all $m \leq \delta n^2$.

Conjectured by Erdős and McKay.
