Erdős Conjecture (Problem #115) [Er61, Er90], proved by Eremenko–Lempert [ErLe94]:

If $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ such that $\{z \in \mathbb{C} : |p(z)| \leq 1\}$
is connected, then
$$\max \{ |p'(z)| : z \in \mathbb{C},\, |p(z)| \leq 1 \} \leq (1/2 + o(1))\, n^2.$$

That is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, every
polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ whose lemniscate is connected satisfies
$|p'(z)| \leq (1/2 + \varepsilon)\, n^2$ for all $z$ in the lemniscate.

The Chebyshev polynomials show that the constant $1/2$ is sharp. Erdős originally
conjectured the bound $n^2/2$ exactly (without the $o(1)$), but Szabados observed that
the stronger form fails. Pommerenke [Po59a] proved the weaker bound $(e/2)\, n^2$.
