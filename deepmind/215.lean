Erdős Problem 215 (Steinhaus Problem):
Does there exist $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ such that every set congruent to $S$
(that is, $S$ after some isometry) contains exactly one point from $\mathbb{Z}^2$?

The answer is yes, proved by Jackson and Mauldin [JaMa02].
Their construction depends on the axiom of choice.
