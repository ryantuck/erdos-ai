# Erdős Problem 732

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/732](https://www.erdosproblems.com/732)

Call a sequence $1 < X_1 \leq \cdots \leq X_m \leq n$ block-compatible if there is a pairwise
balanced block design $A_1, \ldots, A_m \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that $|A_i| = X_i$ for
$1 \leq i \leq m$. (A pairwise block design means every pair in $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ is contained in
exactly one $A_i$.)

Is there some constant $c > 0$ such that for all large $n$ there are
$\geq \exp(c \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot \log n)$ many block-compatible sequences for $\{1, \ldots, n\}$?

Proved by Alon, who showed there are at least $2^{(1/2 + o(1)) \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot \log n}$
block-compatible sequences. Erdős proved the upper bound $\exp(O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \log n))$.

Erdős Problem 732 [Er81]:

There exists a constant $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$, the number
of block-compatible sequences (multisets of block sizes from PBDs on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$)
is at least $\exp(c \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot \log n)$.
