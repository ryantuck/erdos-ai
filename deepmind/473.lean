Erdős Problem 473 (Segal):
There exists a permutation $a_1, a_2, \ldots$ of the positive integers such that
$a_k + a_{k+1}$ is prime for all $k$. The answer is yes, as shown by Odlyzko.

The function $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ represents the sequence (0-indexed), and the three
conditions (injective, values positive, surjective onto positives) together
encode that $a$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto the positive integers.

theorem erdos_473 :
    ∃ a : ℕ → ℕ, Function.Injective a ∧
    (∀ n, 0 < a n) ∧
    (∀ m, 0 < m → ∃ n, a n = m) ∧
    ∀ k, Nat.Prime (a k + a (k + 1)) := by
