Erdős Problem 1119 (Independent of ZFC) [Ha74]:

Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be an infinite cardinal with
$\aleph_0 < \mathfrak{m} < \mathfrak{c} = 2^{\aleph_0}$. Let $\{f_\alpha\}$ be a family of
entire functions such that, for every $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$, the set $\{f_\alpha(z_0)\}$ of
values has at most $\mathfrak{m}$ distinct elements. Must the family of distinct functions
have cardinality at most $\mathfrak{m}$?

This generalizes Wetzel's problem. Erdős proved that for the countable case
($\aleph_0$ values), the answer is yes if $\mathfrak{c} > \aleph_1$ and no if
$\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_1$.
Kumar–Shelah [KuSh17] showed the answer can be yes (with $\mathfrak{m} = \aleph_1$,
$\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_2$), while Schilhan–Weinert [ScWe24] showed it can be no.
