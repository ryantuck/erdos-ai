# Erdős Problem 937

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/937](https://www.erdosproblems.com/937)

Are there infinitely many four-term arithmetic progressions of coprime powerful
numbers (i.e. if $p \mid n$ then $p^2 \mid n$)?

This was proved in the affirmative by Bajpai, Bennett, and Chan [BBC24].

Erdős Problem 937 (proved by Bajpai–Bennett–Chan [BBC24]):

There are infinitely many four-term arithmetic progressions of pairwise coprime
powerful numbers. Formulated as: for every $N$, there exist $a > 0$, $d > 0$ with
$a \geq N$ such that $a$, $a+d$, $a+2d$, $a+3d$ are all powerful and pairwise coprime.
