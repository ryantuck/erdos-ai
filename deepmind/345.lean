Erdős Problem 345 [ErGr80, p.55]:

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a complete sequence, and define the threshold of completeness
$T(A)$ to be the least integer $m$ such that all $n \ge m$ are in
$P(A) = \{\sum_{n \in B} n : B \subseteq A, B \text{ finite}\}$.

Is it true that there are infinitely many $k$ such that $T(n^k) > T(n^{k+1})$?

Known values: $T(n) = 1$, $T(n^2) = 128$, $T(n^3) = 12758$, $T(n^4) = 5134240$,
and $T(n^5) = 67898771$.
