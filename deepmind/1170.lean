Is it consistent that $\omega_2 \to (\alpha)^2_2$ for every $\alpha < \omega_2$?

The arrow notation $\kappa \to (\alpha)^2_2$ denotes the ordinal partition relation: for every
2-coloring of pairs of ordinals below $\kappa$, there exists a monochromatic set of
order type $\alpha$.

This is a consistency question: is there a model of ZFC in which this holds?
We formalize the property itself.

Known partial results:
- Laver [La82] proved the consistency of $\omega_2 \to (\omega_1 \cdot 2 + 1, \alpha)^2$
  for all $\alpha < \omega_2$.
- Foreman–Hajnal [FoHa03] proved the consistency of
  $\omega_2 \to (\omega_1^2 + 1, \alpha)^2$ for all $\alpha < \omega_2$.
