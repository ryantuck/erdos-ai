# Erdős Problem 919

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/919](https://www.erdosproblems.com/919)

This question was inspired by a theorem of Babai, that if $G$ is a graph on a
well-ordered set with chromatic number $\geq \aleph_0$ there is a subgraph on
vertices with order-type $\omega$ with chromatic number $\aleph_0$.

Erdős and Hajnal showed this does not generalise to higher cardinals — they
constructed a graph on $\omega_1^2$ with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ such that
every strictly smaller subgraph has chromatic number $\leq \aleph_0$.

A similar construction produces a graph on $\omega_2^2$ with chromatic number
$\aleph_2$ such that every smaller subgraph has chromatic number $\leq \aleph_1$.

Erdős Problem 919 [Er69b]:

Is there a graph on a well-ordered set of order type $\omega_2 \cdot \omega_2$ with chromatic
number $\aleph_2$ such that every subgraph induced on a subset of strictly smaller
order type has chromatic number $\leq \aleph_0$?

Erdős Problem 919, variant [Er69b]:

What if instead we ask for $G$ to have chromatic number $\aleph_1$?

Is there a graph on a well-ordered set of order type $\omega_2 \cdot \omega_2$ with chromatic
number exactly $\aleph_1$ such that every subgraph induced on a subset of strictly
smaller order type has chromatic number $\leq \aleph_0$?
