# Erdős Problem 763

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/763](https://www.erdosproblems.com/763)

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Can there exist some constant $c > 0$ such that
$$\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A(n) = cN + O(1)?$$
Here $1_A \ast 1_A(n)$ denotes the number of representations of $n$ as $a + b$
with $a, b \in A$.

A conjecture of Erdős and Turán [Er65b][Er70c].

Disproved: Erdős and Fuchs [ErFu56] proved the answer is no in a strong
form: even $\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A(n) = cN + o(N^{1/4} / (\log N)^{1/2})$
is impossible. The error term was later improved to $o(N^{1/4})$ by
Jurkat (unpublished) and Montgomery–Vaughan [MoVa90].

Erdős Problem 763 (Erdős–Fuchs theorem) [ErFu56]:

For any $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and any $c > 0$, the partial sums
$\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A(n)$ cannot satisfy
$\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A(n) = cN + O(1)$. That is, the error
term $|\sum_{n \leq N} 1_A \ast 1_A(n) - cN|$ is unbounded.
