# Erdős Problem 8

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/8](https://www.erdosproblems.com/8)

The original Erdős–Graham conjecture asked: for any finite colouring of the positive integers,
must there exist a covering system all of whose moduli are monochromatic?

The answer is **no**, as a consequence of Hough's theorem [Ho15] that every covering system
must contain a modulus below an absolute bound (at most $10^{16}$, later improved to $616000$
by Balister, Bollobás, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba [BBMST22]). One can therefore assign a
distinct colour to each integer up to this bound and a single fresh colour to all larger integers;
any covering system must then contain a small modulus with a unique colour, making
monochromaticity impossible.

A finite system of congruences $\{(a_i, m_i)\}$ is a **covering system** if every
modulus is positive and every integer satisfies at least one congruence $n \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}$.

  (∀ n : ℤ, ∃ p ∈ S, (p.2 : ℤ) ∣ (n - p.1))

/--
All moduli in a covering system are **monochromatic** under a colouring $\chi : \mathbb{N} \to \text{Fin}\, k$
if there exists a colour $c$ such that every modulus in $S$ receives colour $c$.

The Erdős–Graham conjecture asked: for any finite colouring of the positive integers,
must there exist a covering system all of whose moduli are monochromatic?

The answer is **no**: there exists a finite colouring of the positive integers such that no
covering system has all its moduli the same colour. This follows from Hough's theorem [Ho15]
that every covering system must contain a modulus below an absolute bound.
