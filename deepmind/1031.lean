**Erdős Problem 1031** [Er93, p.340]:

If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with no clique and no independent set of size
$\geq 10 \log n$, then $G$ contains an induced regular subgraph on $\geq c \log n$ vertices
(for some absolute constant $c > 0$) that is neither empty nor complete.

This was proved by Prömel and Rödl [PrRo99], who showed the stronger result
that for any $c > 0$, if $G$ contains no trivial subgraph on $\geq c \log n$ vertices
then $G$ contains all graphs with $O_c(\log n)$ vertices as induced subgraphs.
