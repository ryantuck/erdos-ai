Is there a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that
$|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \ll N / \log N$ and every sufficiently large integer can be
written as $2^k + a$ for some $k \geq 0$ and $a \in A$?

The answer is yes, proved by Ruzsa (1972).

theorem erdos_221 :
    ∃ (A : Set ℕ),
      (∃ (C : ℝ), C > 0 ∧ ∃ N₀ : ℕ, ∀ N : ℕ, N₀ ≤ N →
        (((Finset.Icc 1 N).filter (fun n => n ∈ A)).card : ℝ) ≤ C * ↑N / Real.log ↑N) ∧
      (∃ M : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, M ≤ n → ∃ k : ℕ, ∃ a ∈ A, n = 2 ^ k + a) := by
