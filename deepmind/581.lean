The maximum number of edges in a bipartite spanning subgraph of a graph $G$ on
a finite vertex type. A spanning subgraph $H \leq G$ is bipartite iff it admits a
proper 2-coloring. We use `Set.ncard` to count edges, avoiding the need for
decidability instances.

$f(m)$ is the largest $k$ such that every triangle-free graph on $m$ edges must
contain a bipartite subgraph with at least $k$ edges. Equivalently, $f(m)$ is
the infimum of `maxBipartiteEdges G` over all finite triangle-free graphs $G$
with exactly $m$ edges. We quantify over graphs on `Fin n` for all $n$, which
suffices since every finite graph is isomorphic to one on `Fin n`.

Erdős Problem 581 [CEG79]:

Let $f(m)$ be the maximal $k$ such that a triangle-free graph on $m$ edges must
contain a bipartite graph with $k$ edges. Determine $f(m)$.

Resolved by Alon [Al96], who showed that there exist constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$
such that $m/2 + c_1 \cdot m^{4/5} \leq f(m) \leq m/2 + c_2 \cdot m^{4/5}$.
