Erdős Problem 806 [ErNe77]:

For any $\varepsilon > 0$, for all sufficiently large $n$, for any $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$
with $|A| \leq \sqrt{n}$, there exists a finite set $B \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with
$|B| \leq \varepsilon \cdot \sqrt{n}$ such that every element of $A$ (viewed in $\mathbb{Z}$)
belongs to $B + B$.

This captures the $o(\sqrt{n})$ conjecture. It was resolved by Alon, Bukh, and
Sudakov [ABS09] with the sharper bound $|B| \leq C \cdot (\log \log n / \log n) \cdot \sqrt{n}$.
