Erdős Problem 337 [ErGr80] [ErGr80b]:

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be an additive basis (of any finite order) such that
$|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| = o(N)$. Is it true that
$$\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{|(A+A) \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}|}{|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}|} = \infty?$$

The answer is no. A counterexample was provided by Turjányi [Tu84].
This was generalised (replacing $A+A$ by the $h$-fold sumset $hA$ for any
$h \geq 2$) by Ruzsa and Turjányi [RT85].
