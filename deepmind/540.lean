Erdős Problem 540 (Erdős–Heilbronn conjecture):

Is it true that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ has size $\gg N^{1/2}$ then there exists
some non-empty $S \subseteq A$ such that $\sum_{n \in S} n \equiv 0 \pmod{N}$?

The answer is yes. This was proved for $N$ prime by Olson [Ol68], and for all $N$ by
Szemerédi [Sz70] (in fact for arbitrary finite abelian groups).

Erdős speculated that the correct threshold is $(2N)^{1/2}$; this was proved for $N$ prime
by Balandraud [Ba12].
