# Erdős Problem 1136

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1136](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1136)

Does there exist $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with lower density $> 1/3$ such that $a + b \neq 2^k$
for any $a, b \in A$ and $k \geq 0$?

A question asked by Erdős at the DMV conference in Berlin 1987. Achieving density $1/3$ is trivial,
taking $A$ to be all multiples of $3$.

Müller [Mu11] settled this question in the affirmative: one can take $A$ to be the set of all
integers congruent to $3 \cdot 2^i \pmod{2^{i+2}}$ for any $i \geq 0$, which has density $1/2$.
Müller also proved this is best possible, in that such $A$ has lower density at most $1/2$.

Erdős Problem 1136 (Proved by Müller [Mu11]):
There exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with lower density strictly greater than $1/3$ such that
no two elements of $A$ sum to a power of $2$.

The lower density condition is formalized as: there exists $\delta > 1/3$ and $N_0$
such that $|A \cap [1, N]| \geq \delta \cdot N$ for all $N \geq N_0$.
