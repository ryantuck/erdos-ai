# Erdős Problem 439

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/439](https://www.erdosproblems.com/439)

Is it true that, in any finite colouring of the integers, there must be two
integers $x \ne y$ of the same colour such that $x + y$ is a square? What about
a $k$-th power?

A question of Roth, Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós. Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós proved
this for 2 or 3 colours.

This was proved by Khalfalah and Szemerédi [KhSz06], who showed the general
result with $x + y = z^2$ replaced by $x + y = f(z)$ for any non-constant
$f(z) \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ such that $2 \mid f(z)$ for some $z \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Since $k$-th powers include even values (take $z$ even), the $k$-th power case
follows.

solutions of $x + y = z^2$_. Combinatorics, Probability and Computing (2006),

/-- Erdős Problem 439, square case:
In any finite colouring of the natural numbers, there exist distinct $x$ and $y$
of the same colour such that $x + y$ is a perfect square.

Proved by Khalfalah and Szemerédi [KhSz06]. -/

theorem erdos_439 (c : ℕ) (f : ℕ → Fin c) :
    ∃ x y : ℕ, x ≠ y ∧ f x = f y ∧ IsSquare (x + y) := by

/-- Erdős Problem 439, $k$-th power generalization:
In any finite colouring of the natural numbers, there exist distinct $x$ and $y$
of the same colour such that $x + y$ is a perfect $k$-th power (i.e., $z^k$ for
some $z$).

Also follows from the result of Khalfalah and Szemerédi [KhSz06]. -/
