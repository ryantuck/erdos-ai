# Erdős Problem 1050

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1050](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1050)

Is $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n - 3}$ irrational?

Erdős [Er48] proved that $\sum 1/(2^n - 1) = \sum \tau(n)/2^n$ is irrational (where
$\tau(n)$ is the divisor function). He notes [Er88c] that $\sum 1/(2^n + t)$ should be
transcendental for every integer $t$ (with the obvious exception $t = 0$).

This was proved by Borwein [Bo91], who more generally proved that, for any
integer $q \geq 2$ and rational $r \neq 0$ (distinct from $-q^n$ for all $n \geq 1$), the
series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/(q^n + r)$ is irrational.
