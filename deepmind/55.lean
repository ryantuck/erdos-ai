A set $A$ of natural numbers is Ramsey $r$-complete if for every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$,
all sufficiently large natural numbers can be represented as a sum of distinct
elements of $A$ that all receive the same color.

Erdős Problem 55 (solved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham [CFP21]):
For every $r \geq 2$, there exists an $r$-Ramsey complete set $A$ such that
$|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \leq C \cdot r \cdot (\log N)^2$ for all sufficiently large $N$.

There exists $c > 0$ such that any set $A$ with
$|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \leq c \cdot r \cdot (\log N)^2$ for all large $N$
cannot be $r$-Ramsey complete, showing the upper bound is best possible [CFP21].
