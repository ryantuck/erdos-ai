A finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfies the "no three equidistant from a center"
condition if for each point $p$ in the set, no three other distinct points in the
set are equidistant from $p$ (i.e., no circle centered at $p$ passes through three
or more other points).

Erdős Problem 655 (Erdős–Pach):
Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^2$ be such that no circle whose centre is one of the $x_i$
contains three other points. Then the number of distinct distances determined
by the points is at least $(1 + c) \cdot n / 2$ for some constant $c > 0$ and all $n$
sufficiently large.
