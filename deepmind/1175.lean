/-- The graph $G$ has cardinal chromatic number equal to $\kappa$ if $\kappa$ is the minimum
cardinality of a color set admitting a proper coloring of $G$:
- there exists a proper coloring with a color set of cardinality $\leq \kappa$, and
- every proper coloring uses a color set of cardinality $\geq \kappa$.

Here `G.Coloring α` is a graph homomorphism from $G$ to the complete graph on $\alpha$,
i.e., a function assigning colors in $\alpha$ to vertices such that adjacent
vertices receive distinct colors. -/

Erdős Problem 1175 [Va99, 7.92]:

Let $\kappa$ be an uncountable cardinal. Must there exist a cardinal $\lambda$ such that
every graph with chromatic number $\lambda$ contains a triangle-free subgraph
with chromatic number $\kappa$?

Here `HasChromaticNumber G κ` means $\kappa$ is the minimum cardinality of a color set
admitting a proper coloring of $G$. Triangle-free means `G.CliqueFree 3` (no
3-clique, i.e., no triangle). The subgraph relation $H \leq G$ holds when every
edge of $H$ is also an edge of $G$.

Shelah proved that a negative answer is consistent if $\kappa = \lambda = \aleph_1$.
