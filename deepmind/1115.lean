Erdős Problem 1115 (Disproved by Gol'dberg and Eremenko [GoEr79]):

Let $f(z)$ be an entire function of finite order, and let $\Gamma$ be a rectifiable path
on which $f(z) \to \infty$. Let $\ell(r)$ be the length of $\Gamma$ in the disc $|z| < r$.

Can such a path $\Gamma$ always be found with $\ell(r) \ll r$?

Disproved: Gol'dberg and Eremenko showed that for any $\varphi(r) \to \infty$ there is an
entire function $f$ with $\log M(r) \ll \varphi(r)(\log r)^2$ such that there is no path
$\Gamma$ on which $f(z) \to \infty$ and $\ell(r) \ll r$. They also construct such functions
of any prescribed finite order in $[0, \infty)$.

Formally: there exists an entire function of finite order such that for every
arc-length parameterized path to infinity on which $f \to \infty$, $\ell(r)$ is not $O(r)$.
