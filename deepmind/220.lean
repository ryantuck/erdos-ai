Erdős Problem 220 [Er40, Er55c, Er57, Er61, Er65b, Er73, Er79, ErGr80, Er81k, Er85c]:

Let $n \ge 1$ and $A = \{a_1 < \cdots < a_{\varphi(n)}\} = \{1 \le m < n : \gcd(m,n) = 1\}$ be the
totatives of $n$ listed in increasing order. Is it true that
$$\sum_{1 \le k < \varphi(n)} (a_{k+1} - a_k)^2 \ll n^2 / \varphi(n)?$$

The answer is yes, as proved by Montgomery and Vaughan [MoVa86], who showed
the more general result that for any $\gamma \ge 1$,
$$\sum_{1 \le k < \varphi(n)} (a_{k+1} - a_k)^\gamma \ll n^\gamma / \varphi(n)^{\gamma-1}.$$
