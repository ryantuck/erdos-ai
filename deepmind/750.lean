Erdős Problem 750 [Er94b][Er95d]:

Does there exist, for every function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with $f(m) \to \infty$
as $m \to \infty$, a graph $G$ with infinite chromatic number such that every finite set of
$m$ vertices in $G$ contains an independent set of size at least $m/2 - f(m)$?

In [Er69b] Erdős conjectures this for $f(m) = \varepsilon m$ for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$.
This follows from a result of Erdős, Hajnal, and Szemerédi [EHS82].

In [ErHa67b] Erdős and Hajnal prove this for $f(m) \geq cm$ for all $c > 1/4$.
