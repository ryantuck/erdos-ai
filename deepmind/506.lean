Erdős Problem 506 [Er61, p. 245]:

What is the minimum number of circles determined by $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, not all on a
circle (and not all on a line)?

Elliott [El67] proved that for $n > 393$ points not all on a circle or a line, the
points determine at least $\binom{n-1}{2}$ distinct circles. Purdy and Smith [PuSm]
corrected this to the sharper bound $\binom{n-1}{2} + 1 - \lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor$, which is best
possible (witnessed by $n-1$ points on a circle and one point off it).
