# Erdős Problem 545

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/545](https://www.erdosproblems.com/545)

Let $G$ be a graph with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices. Is the Ramsey number $R(G)$
maximised when $G$ is 'as complete as possible'? That is, if $m = \binom{n}{2} + t$ edges
with $0 \leq t < n$ then is $R(G) \leq R(H)$, where $H$ is the graph formed by connecting a
new vertex to $t$ of the vertices of $K_n$?

A question of Erdős and Graham [ErGr75, Er84b].

Erdős Problem 545 [ErGr75, Er84b]:

Let $G$ be a graph with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices. Is the Ramsey number
$R(G)$ maximised when $G$ is 'as complete as possible'? That is, if
$m = \binom{n}{2} + t$ edges with $0 \leq t < n$ then is $R(G) \leq R(H)$, where $H$
is the graph formed by connecting a new vertex to $t$ of the vertices of $K_n$?
