Erdős Conjecture (Problem 159) [Er81, Er84d]:

There exists a constant $c > 0$ such that $R(C_4, K_n) \ll n^{2-c}$, i.e.,
$R(C_4, K_n) = O(n^{2-c})$ as $n \to \infty$.

The Ramsey number $R(C_4, K_n)$ is the minimum $N$ such that every 2-colouring
of the edges of $K_N$ contains a monochromatic $C_4$ in one colour or a
monochromatic $K_n$ in the other colour.

The current bounds are:
$$n^{3/2} / (\log n)^{3/2} \ll R(C_4, K_n) \ll n^2 / (\log n)^2,$$
where the upper bound is due to Szemerédi [EFRS78] and the lower bound
to Spencer [Sp77]. Improving the upper bound to $n^{2-c}$ for any fixed
$c > 0$ remains open.
