/--
An $n$-uniform hypergraph is a finite collection of edges where each edge
has exactly $n$ vertices.
-/
def IsNUniform (H : Finset (Finset ℕ)) (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ e ∈ H, e.card = n

/--
A hypergraph has Property B (is $2$-colorable) if there exists a $2$-coloring
of the vertex set such that no edge is monochromatic, i.e., every edge
contains vertices of both colors.
-/
def HasPropertyB (H : Finset (Finset ℕ)) : Prop :=
  ∃ f : ℕ → Bool, ∀ e ∈ H, (∃ x ∈ e, f x = true) ∧ (∃ x ∈ e, f x = false)

Erdős Problem 901 (Erdős–Lovász Conjecture), lower bound:
Let $m(n)$ be minimal such that there is an $n$-uniform hypergraph with $m(n)$ edges
that does not have Property B. Erdős and Lovász conjecture that $m(n)$ is of
order $n \cdot 2^n$.

Lower bound: there exists $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
every $n$-uniform hypergraph without Property B has at least $c \cdot n \cdot 2^n$ edges.

Erdős Problem 901 (Erdős–Lovász Conjecture), upper bound:
There exists $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$, there exists
an $n$-uniform hypergraph without Property B with at most $c \cdot n \cdot 2^n$ edges.
