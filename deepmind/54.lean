# Erdős Problem 54

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/54](https://www.erdosproblems.com/54)

There exists a Ramsey 2-complete set $A$ (every large integer is a monochromatic subset sum
under any 2-colouring) with $|A \cap \{1,\ldots,N\}| \leq c (\log N)^2$.
Resolved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham [CFP21].

A set $A$ of natural numbers is Ramsey $r$-complete if for every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$,
all sufficiently large natural numbers can be represented as a sum of distinct
elements of $A$ that all receive the same color.

Erdős Problem 54 (resolved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham [CFP21]):
There exists a Ramsey 2-complete set $A$ of positive integers and a constant $c > 0$
such that $|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \leq c \cdot (\log N)^2$ for all sufficiently large $N$.

This improves the upper bound $(2 \log_2 N)^3$ of Burr and Erdős [BuEr85], matching the
lower bound order of $(\log N)^2$.

Lower bound (Burr–Erdős [BuEr85]): there exists $c > 0$ such that any set $A$ with
$|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \leq c \cdot (\log N)^2$ for all large $N$ cannot be
Ramsey 2-complete. Together with `erdos_54`, this shows the optimal growth rate
is $\Theta((\log N)^2)$.
