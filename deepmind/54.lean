A set $A$ of natural numbers is Ramsey 2-complete if for every 2-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$,
all sufficiently large natural numbers can be represented as a sum of distinct
elements of $A$ that all receive the same color.

Erdős Problem 54 (resolved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham [CFP21]):
There exists a Ramsey 2-complete set $A$ of positive integers and a constant $c > 0$
such that $|A \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| \leq c \cdot (\log N)^2$ for all sufficiently large $N$.

This improves the upper bound $(2 \log_2 N)^3$ of Burr and Erdős, matching the
lower bound order of $(\log N)^2$.
