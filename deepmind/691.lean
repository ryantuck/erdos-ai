# Erdős Problem 691

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/691](https://www.erdosproblems.com/691)

Given $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, let $M_A = \{n \geq 1 : a \mid n \text{ for some } a \in A\}$
be the set of multiples of $A$. A sequence $A$ for which $M_A$ has density $1$ is called
a *Behrend sequence*.

For pairwise coprime sets of integers (all $\geq 2$), a necessary and sufficient condition
for $A$ to be a Behrend sequence is $\sum_{a \in A} 1/a = \infty$.

The general characterization remains open.

Erdős Problem 691 (pairwise coprime case) [Er79e]:
If $A$ is a set of pairwise coprime integers (all $\geq 2$), then $A$ is a Behrend
sequence if and only if the sum of reciprocals $\sum_{a \in A} 1/a$ diverges.
