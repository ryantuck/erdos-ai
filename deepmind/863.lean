# Erdős Problem 863

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/863](https://www.erdosproblems.com/863)

A problem of Erdős [Er92c], first formulated in conversation with Berend, and later
independently reformulated with Freud. It is known that $c_1 = c_1' = 1$ (the classical
bound on Sidon sets).

Erdős Problem 863, weak form [Er92c]:

If the limits $c_r = \lim_{N \to \infty} f_r^+(N) / \sqrt{N}$ (maximum $B_2[r]$ set size)
and $c_r' = \lim_{N \to \infty} f_r^-(N) / \sqrt{N}$ (maximum difference-$r$-bounded set
size) both exist, then $c_r \neq c_r'$ for $r \geq 2$.
