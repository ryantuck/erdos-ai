# Erdős Problem 654

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/654](https://www.erdosproblems.com/654)

Let $f(n)$ be such that, given any $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^2$ with no four points on a
circle, there exists some $x_i$ with at least $f(n)$ many distinct distances to other $x_j$.
Is it true that $f(n) > (1/3 + c)n$ for some $c > 0$, for all large $n$?

The trivial bound is $f(n) \geq (n-1)/3$. The stronger conjecture $f(n) > (1-o(1))n$
was disproved by Aletheia [Fe26].

A problem of Erdős and Pach [Er87b][ErPa90][Er97e].

Erdős Problem 654 [Er87b][ErPa90][Er97e]:

There exists a constant $c > 0$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
given any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no four on a circle, there exists some
point with at least $(1/3 + c) \cdot n$ distinct distances to the other points.
