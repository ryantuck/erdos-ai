Erdős Problem 1112 [ErGr80]:

Define $r_k(d_1, d_2)$ to be the smallest integer $r$ (if it exists) such that for any
lacunary sequence $B = \{b_1 < b_2 < \cdots\}$ of positive integers with
$b_{i+1} \geq r \cdot b_i$, there exists a sequence $A = \{a_1 < a_2 < \cdots\}$ of
positive integers with $d_1 \leq a_{i+1} - a_i \leq d_2$ for all $i$, and
$(kA) \cap B = \emptyset$, where $kA$ is the $k$-fold sumset.

Known results:
- $r_2(2,3) = 2$ and $r_2(a,b) \leq 2$ for $a < b$ with $b \neq 2a$
  (Erdős–Graham, Chen).
- $r_3(2,3)$ does not exist: Bollobás, Hegyvári, and Jin showed that for any
  arbitrarily fast growing sequence of lacunary ratios, there exists $B$ such
  that $(A+A+A) \cap B \neq \emptyset$ for all $A$ with gaps in $[2,3]$.
- Further non-existence results by Tang and Yang.
- The general question of existence of $r_k(d_1, d_2)$ for $k \geq 3$ remains open.

We state the non-existence direction (consistent with all known results):
for all $k \geq 3$ and valid $d_1 < d_2$, $r_k(d_1, d_2)$ does not exist. That is, for
every lacunary ratio $r$, there exists a lacunary sequence $B$ with ratio $r$ such
that no gap-bounded sequence $A$ avoids $B$ with its $k$-fold sumset.
