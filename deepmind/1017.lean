# Erdős Problem 1017

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1017](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1017)

Let $f(n,k)$ be such that every graph on $n$ vertices and $k$ edges can be
partitioned into at most $f(n,k)$ edge-disjoint complete graphs. Estimate
$f(n,k)$ for $k > n^2/4$.

The function $f(n,k)$ is sometimes called the clique partition number.

Erdős, Goodman, and Pósa [EGP66] proved that $f(n,k) \le \lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$ for all $k$
(and in fact edges and triangles suffice), which is best possible in general,
as witnessed by a complete bipartite graph. Erdős [Er71] asks whether this
bound can be sharpened when $k > n^2/4$.

Erdős Problem 1017 (Erdős–Goodman–Pósa) [Er71, EGP66]:

Every simple graph $G$ on $n$ vertices can be decomposed into at most $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$
edge-disjoint complete subgraphs.

Erdős asks whether this bound can be improved when the number of edges
exceeds $n^2/4$.
