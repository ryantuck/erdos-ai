# Erdős Problem 436

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/436](https://www.erdosproblems.com/436)

For prime $p$ and $k, m \geq 2$, let $r(k,m,p)$ be the minimal $r$ such that
$r, r+1, \ldots, r+m-1$ are all $k$-th power residues modulo $p$.
Let $\Lambda(k,m) = \limsup_{p \to \infty} r(k,m,p)$.

Hildebrand [Hi91] proved that $\Lambda(k,2)$ is finite for all $k \geq 2$.
Graham [Gr64g] proved that $\Lambda(k,\ell) = \infty$ for all $k \geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$.
Lehmer and Lehmer [LeLe62] proved that $\Lambda(k,3) = \infty$ for all even $k$.

The remaining open question is whether $\Lambda(k,3)$ is finite for all odd $k \geq 5$.
