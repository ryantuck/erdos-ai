Erdős Problem 151 [Er88, p.82] [EGT92, p.280] (problem of Erdős and Gallai):
If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices then $\tau(G) \leq n - H(n)$,
where $\tau(G)$ is the clique transversal number of $G$ and $H(n)$ is the maximum $k$
such that every triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices contains an independent set
of size $k$.
