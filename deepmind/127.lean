For a finite simple graph $G$ and a vertex subset $S$, the cut defined by $S$
consists of edges with exactly one endpoint in $S$. We count these as ordered pairs
$(v, w)$ with $v \in S$, $w \notin S$, and $v \sim w$; since the adjacency relation
is symmetric and $S$ and $S^c$ are disjoint, each undirected cut edge is counted exactly
once (from its $S$-side endpoint).

The maximum bipartite subgraph size of $G$: the maximum over all vertex bipartitions
$(S, S^c)$ of the number of edges crossing the cut. This equals the maximum number of
edges in any bipartite subgraph of $G$ (the max-cut).

least $m/2 + (\sqrt{8m+1} - 1)/8$. Proved by Edwards [Ed73].

$f(m)$ is the maximal value $r$ such that every finite simple graph with $m$ edges has a
bipartite subgraph with at least $\operatorname{edwardsLB}(m) + r$ edges. Equivalently,
$f(m)$ is the infimum over all finite simple graphs $G$ with exactly $m$ edges of the excess
$$\operatorname{maxBipartiteSubgraphSize}(G) - \operatorname{edwardsLB}(m).$$

Edwards [Ed73] proved $f(m) \geq 0$ for all $m$. Note that
$f\left(\binom{n}{2}\right) = 0$, achieved by $K_n$.

Erdős Problem 127 (Erdős–Kohayakawa–Gyárfás; solved by Alon [Al96]):
Let $f(m)$ be maximal such that every graph with $m$ edges contains a bipartite subgraph with
at least $m/2 + (\sqrt{8m+1} - 1)/8 + f(m)$ edges.
There exists an infinite sequence of integers $(m_i)$ with $m_i \to \infty$ such that
$f(m_i) \to \infty$.

Edwards [Ed73] proved $f(m) \geq 0$ for all $m$.
Alon [Al96] proved this in the affirmative: $f(n^2/2) \gg n^{1/2}$.
Alon [Al96] also showed the upper bound $f(m) \ll m^{1/4}$ for all $m$.
