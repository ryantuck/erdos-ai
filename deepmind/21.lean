$f(n)$ is the minimal size of an intersecting family of $n$-sets that covers
all sets of size at most $n - 1$.

/--
Let $f(n)$ be the minimal size of an intersecting family $F$ of $n$-element sets such that any
set $S$ with $|S| \leq n - 1$ is disjoint from at least one $A \in F$. Then $f(n) \ll n$, i.e.,
there exist constants $C > 0$ and $N_0$ such that $f(n) \leq C \cdot n$ for all $n \geq N_0$.

Erdős and Lovász [ErLo75] proved $(8/3)n - 3 \leq f(n) \ll n^{3/2} \log n$.
Kahn [Ka92b] improved the upper bound to $f(n) \ll n \log n$.
Kahn [Ka94] proved $f(n) \ll n$, settling the conjecture.
