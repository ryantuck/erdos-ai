**Erdős Problem 1022** [Er71, p.105]:

There does NOT exist a function $c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ with
$c(t) \to \infty$ as $t \to \infty$ such that the following holds: for every
$t$ and every finite hypergraph $\mathcal{F}$ on $n$ vertices, if all edges
have size $\geq t$ and for every vertex set $X$ the number of edges contained
in $X$ is $< c(t) \cdot |X|$, then $\mathcal{F}$ has property B.

Disproved by Wood [Wo13b].
