# Erdős Problem 682

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/682](https://www.erdosproblems.com/682)

[GaTa25] Gafni, A. and Tao, T., who showed the number of exceptional
$n \in [1, X]$ is $\ll X / (\log X)^2$.

Erdős Problem 682: For almost all $n$, there exists an integer $m$ strictly
between consecutive primes $p_n$ and $p_{n+1}$ whose least prime factor is at
least as large as the prime gap $p_{n+1} - p_n$.

"Almost all" is formalized as: the exceptional set has natural density zero.

Proved by Gafni and Tao [GaTa25].

    ∃ N₀ : ℕ, ∀ N : ℕ, N₀ ≤ N →
