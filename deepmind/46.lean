# Erdős Problem 46

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/46](https://www.erdosproblems.com/46)

For every finite colouring of the integers $\geq 2$, there exists a monochromatic finite
set whose reciprocals sum to $1$. Proved by Croot [Cr03].

For every $k$-colouring (with $k \ge 2$) of the positive integers $\ge 2$, there exists a
monochromatic finite set $\{n_1, \ldots, n_m\}$ with $2 \le n_1 < \cdots < n_m$ whose
reciprocals sum to $1$, i.e. $\sum 1/n_i = 1$.

Proved by Croot [Cr03]. Originally posed by Erdős and Graham [ErGr80].

Generalization of `erdos_46` to arbitrary positive rationals: for every $k$-colouring
(with $k \ge 2$) of the positive integers $\ge 2$ and every positive rational $q$, there
exists a monochromatic finite subset whose reciprocals sum to $q$.

This follows from the unit case by considering induced colorings on $\{n/b : b \mid n\}$.
