Erdős Problem 1006 (disproved) [Er71][Er76b]:

Let $G$ be a graph with girth $> 4$ (i.e., $G$ contains no cycles of length $3$ or $4$).
Can the edges of $G$ always be directed such that there is no directed cycle, and
reversing the direction of any edge also creates no directed cycle?

This was disproved by Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo78b], who proved that for every
integer $g$, there is a graph $G$ with girth $g$ such that every orientation of $G$ either
contains a directed cycle or contains a cycle obtained by reversing one edge.
