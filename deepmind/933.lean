Erdős Problem 933 [Er76d]:

If $n(n+1) = 2^k \cdot 3^l \cdot m$ where $\gcd(m, 6) = 1$, is it true that
$$\limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^k \cdot 3^l}{n \log n} = \infty?$$

Equivalently: for every $C > 0$, there exist arbitrarily large $n$ such that
the $\{2,3\}$-smooth part of $n(n+1)$ exceeds $C \cdot n \cdot \log n$.

Mahler proved that $2^k \cdot 3^l < n^{1+o(1)}$.
Erdős wrote that 'it is easy to see' that for infinitely many $n$,
$2^k \cdot 3^l > n \cdot \log n$.
