Erdős Problem 1160 [Va99, 5.71]:

Let $g(n)$ denote the number of groups of order $n$. If $n \le 2^m$ then $g(n) \le g(2^m)$.

This conjecture states that among all $n \le 2^m$, the value $g(n)$ is maximized
at $n = 2^m$ (i.e., powers of 2 have the most groups of any order up to that
point). Listed as Question 22.16 in [BNV07], attributed to Erdős and Higman.
