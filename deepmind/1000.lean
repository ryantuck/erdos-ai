# Erdős Problem 1000

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1000](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1000)

Let $A = \{n_1 < n_2 < \cdots\}$ be an infinite sequence of integers, and let $\varphi_A(k)$
count the number of $1 \leq m \leq n_k$ such that the fraction $m/n_k$ does not have
denominator $n_j$ for $j < k$ when written in lowest form; equivalently,
$n_k / \gcd(m, n_k) \neq n_j$ for all $1 \leq j < k$.

Is there a sequence $A$ such that
$$\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k \leq N} \frac{\varphi_A(k)}{n_k} = 0?$$

Erdős believed no such sequence exists. This was solved by Haight [Ha] who
proved that such a sequence does exist (contrary to Erdős' expectations).

Erdős Problem 1000 [Er64b]:

There exists a strictly increasing sequence $A = \{n_1 < n_2 < \cdots\}$ of positive
integers such that the Cesàro mean of $\varphi_A(k)/n_k$ tends to $0$:
$$\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k \leq N} \frac{\varphi_A(k)}{n_k} = 0.$$

Proved by Haight [Ha].
