Erdős Problem 838 (Erdős–Hammer):
Let $f(n)$ be the maximum number such that any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three
collinear, determine at least $f(n)$ different convex subsets. Does there exist
a constant $c$ such that
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log f(n)}{(\log n)^2} = c?$$

Erdős proved that $n^{c_1 \log n} < f(n) < n^{c_2 \log n}$ for some constants
$c_1, c_2 > 0$ [Er78c].
