/-- A positive odd integer $m$ is a *Sierpiński number* if $2^k \cdot m + 1$ is composite
for all $k \geq 0$. -/

/-- A finite set of primes $P$ is a *covering set* for $m$ if every $2^k \cdot m + 1$ is
divisible by some prime $p \in P$. -/

Are there Sierpiński numbers with no finite covering set of primes? [ErGr80, p.27]

Erdős and Graham conjectured the answer is yes, since otherwise this would imply there
are infinitely many Fermat primes. Filaseta, Finch, and Kozek [FFK08] give evidence
that $m = 734110615000775^4$ is a Sierpiński number without a covering set.
