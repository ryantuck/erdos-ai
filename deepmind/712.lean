# Erdős Problem 712

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/712](https://www.erdosproblems.com/712)

Determine, for any $k > r > 2$, the value of
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathrm{ex}_r(n, K_k^r) / \binom{n}{r},$$
where $\mathrm{ex}_r(n, K_k^r)$ is the largest number of $r$-edges which can be placed on $n$
vertices so that there exists no set of $k$ vertices which is covered by all
$\binom{k}{r}$ possible $r$-edges.

Turán proved that, when $r = 2$, this limit is $\frac{1}{2}(1 - \frac{1}{k-1})$.

Erdős offered \$500 for the determination of this value for any fixed $k > r > 2$,
and \$1000 for 'clearing up the whole set of problems'.

See also [500] for the case $r = 3$ and $k = 4$.

Erdős Conjecture (Problem 712) — Hypergraph Turán Densities:

For any $k > r > 2$, the Turán density
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathrm{ex}_r(n, K_k^r) / \binom{n}{r}$$
exists. Determining the value of this limit for any such $k$, $r$ is the open
problem.
