# Erdős Problem 660

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/660](https://www.erdosproblems.com/660)

Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be the vertices of a convex polyhedron. Are there at
least $(1 - o(1))n/2$ many distinct distances between the $x_i$?

For the similar problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ there are always at least $n/2$ distances,
as proved by Altman [Al63] (see [93]).

**Erdős Problem 660** [Er97e, p.531]:

Let $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be the vertices of a convex polyhedron. Then the number
of distinct distances determined by these points is at least $(1 - o(1)) \cdot n/2$,
i.e., for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, the number of
distinct distances is at least $(1 - \varepsilon) \cdot n/2$.
