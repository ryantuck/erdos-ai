# Erdős Problem 77

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/77](https://www.erdosproblems.com/77)

If $R(k)$ is the diagonal Ramsey number, the minimal $n$ such that every 2-colouring
of the edges of $K_n$ contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$, then find the value of
$$\lim_{k \to \infty} R(k)^{1/k}.$$

Erdős proved $\sqrt{2} \leq \liminf R(k)^{1/k} \leq \limsup R(k)^{1/k} \leq 4$.
The upper bound has been improved to $3.7992\ldots$ by Gupta, Ndiaye, Norin, and
Wei [GNNW24], building on the breakthrough of Campos, Griffiths, Morris,
and Sahasrabudhe [CGMS23] who first improved the upper bound below 4.

Erdős offered \$250 for solving this problem.

Erdős Problem 77:

The limit $\lim_{k \to \infty} R(k)^{1/k}$ exists, where $R(k)$ is the diagonal
Ramsey number. Formulated as: there exists a real number $L$ such that
$R(k)^{1/k} \to L$ as $k \to \infty$.
