Erdős Problem 714:

For every $r \geq 2$, the extremal number $\operatorname{ex}(n; K_{r,r})$ satisfies a lower bound
of order $n^{2-1/r}$. That is, there exist $C > 0$ and $N_0$ such that for all
$n \geq N_0$:
$$\operatorname{ex}(n; K_{r,r}) \geq C \cdot n^{2-1/r}.$$

Here $K_{r,r}$ is represented by `completeBipartiteGraph (Fin r) (Fin r)` from
Mathlib, the complete bipartite graph on `Fin r ⊕ Fin r`.

Kövári, Sós, and Turán proved the matching upper bound
$\operatorname{ex}(n; K_{r,r}) \ll n^{2-1/r}$ for all $r \geq 2$. The conjecture asks whether
the lower bound of the same order also holds.

The conjectured lower bound is known for $r = 2$ and $r = 3$.
