# Erdős Problem 737

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/737](https://www.erdosproblems.com/737)

Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$. Must there exist an
edge $e$ such that, for all large $n$, $G$ contains a cycle of length $n$
containing $e$?

A problem of Erdős, Hajnal, and Shelah [EHS74], who proved that $G$ must
contain all sufficiently large cycles (see [594]).

This is true, and was proved by Thomassen [Th83].

Erdős Problem 737 [EHS74] [Er81]:

If $G$ is a graph with chromatic number $\geq \aleph_1$ (uncountable), then there
exists an edge $\{u, v\}$ of $G$ such that for all sufficiently large $n$,
$G$ contains a cycle of length $n$ passing through $\{u, v\}$.

Proved by Thomassen [Th83].
