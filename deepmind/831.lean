A finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has no three collinear if every three-element subset
is not collinear (i.e., no line contains three or more of the points).

def NoThreeCollinear (P : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))) : Prop :=
  ∀ S : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)),
    S ⊆ P → S.card = 3 → ¬Collinear ℝ (S : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)))

Four points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are concyclic if they all lie on a common circle, i.e.,
there exists a center and positive radius such that all four points are
equidistant from the center.

def FourPointsConcyclic (S : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))) : Prop :=
  ∃ c : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2), ∃ r : ℝ, r > 0 ∧ ∀ p ∈ S, dist p c = r

A finite point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has no four concyclic if every four-element subset
does not lie on a common circle.

The number of distinct circumradii of circles passing through three points of $P$.
A radius $r$ is counted if there exist three distinct points $a, b, c \in P$ and a
center $o$ such that all three points lie on the circle of radius $r$ centered at $o$.

noncomputable def distinctCircumradiiCount (P : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))) : ℕ :=
  Set.ncard {r : ℝ | r > 0 ∧ ∃ a ∈ P, ∃ b ∈ P, ∃ c ∈ P,
    a ≠ b ∧ b ≠ c ∧ a ≠ c ∧
    ∃ o : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2), dist a o = r ∧ dist b o = r ∧ dist c o = r}

/--
Let $h(n)$ be maximal such that in any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (with no three on a line
and no four on a circle) there are at least $h(n)$ many circles of different radii
passing through three points. Estimate $h(n)$.

Formalized as: $h(n) \to \infty$, i.e., for every $C$ there exists $N$ such that for all
$n \geq N$ and every set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in general position (no three collinear,
no four concyclic), the number of distinct circumradii of circles through three
points is at least $C$.
