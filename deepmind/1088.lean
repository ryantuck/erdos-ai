# Erdős Problem 1088

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1088](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1088)

Let $f_d(n)$ be the minimal $m$ such that any set of $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contains
a set of $n$ points such that any two determined distances are distinct.
Estimate $f_d(n)$. In particular, is it true that, for fixed $n \geq 3$,
$f_d(n) = 2^{o(d)}$?

A problem of Erdős [Er75f]. It is easy to prove that $f_d(n) \leq n^{O_d(1)}$.
Erdős claimed that he and Straus proved $f_d(n) \leq c_n^d$ for some constant $c_n > 0$.

When $d = 1$, $f_1(n) \asymp n^2$. When $n = 3$, $f_d(3) = d^2/2 + O(d)$.

/-- A finite set of points in a metric space has all pairwise distances
distinct if no two distinct unordered pairs determine the same distance:
whenever $\operatorname{dist}(a, b) = \operatorname{dist}(c, d)$ with $a \neq b$ and $c \neq d$, the pairs
$\{a, b\}$ and $\{c, d\}$ must coincide. -/

Erdős Problem 1088 [Er75f]:

For fixed $n \geq 3$, $f_d(n) = 2^{o(d)}$ as $d \to \infty$. That is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$,
there exists $D_0$ such that for all $d \geq D_0$, $f_d(n) \leq 2^{\varepsilon \cdot d}$.
