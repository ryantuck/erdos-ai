*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/154](https://www.erdosproblems.com/154)

Let $A \subset \{1, \ldots, N\}$ be a Sidon set with $|A| \sim N^{1/2}$.
Must the sumset $A + A$ be well-distributed over all small moduli?

/-- A finite set of natural numbers is a Sidon set (also called a $B_2$ set) if all
pairwise sums $a + b$ (allowing $a = b$) are distinct: whenever $a + b = c + d$
with $a, b, c, d \in A$, we have $\{a, b\} = \{c, d\}$ as multisets. Equivalently,
all differences $a - b$ with $a \neq b$ and $a, b \in A$ are distinct. -/

Erdős Problem \#154 [ESS94]:

Let $A \subset \{1, \ldots, N\}$ be a Sidon set with $|A| \sim N^{1/2}$. Must $A + A$ be
well-distributed over all small moduli? In particular, must about half
the elements of $A + A$ be even and half odd?

Proved in the affirmative. Lindström [Li98] showed that $A$ itself is
well-distributed modulo small integers (e.g. $|A \cap \{\text{evens}\}| \approx |A|/2$),
subsequently strengthened by Kolountzakis [Ko99]. The extension to $A + A$
follows immediately from the Sidon property: if $A$ has $e$ even and $o$ odd
elements, then $A + A$ has exactly $e(e+1)/2 + o(o+1)/2$ even elements
and $eo$ odd elements (all distinct by the Sidon property), and the
distribution is approximately $1/2$ each when $e \approx o \approx |A|/2$.

Formalized as: for any sequence $(A_n)_n$ of Sidon sets $A_n \subset \{0, \ldots, n\}$
with $|A_n| / \sqrt{n} \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$, and any fixed modulus $m \geq 1$ and
residue $0 \leq r < m$, the fraction of elements of $A_n + A_n$ in residue
class $r \bmod m$ tends to $1/m$.
