Erdős Problem 1116 (Solved by Gol'dberg [Go78] and Toppila [To76]):

For a meromorphic function $f$, let $n(r,a)$ count the number of roots of $f(z) = a$
in the disc $|z| < r$. Does there exist a meromorphic (or entire) $f$ such that
for every $a \neq b$, $\limsup_{r\to\infty} n(r,a)/n(r,b) = \infty$?

Gol'dberg and Toppila independently constructed entire functions with this property.

The $\limsup = \infty$ condition is expressed multiplicatively: for every $M$ and $R$,
there exists $r > R$ with $n(r,a) > M \cdot n(r,b)$.
