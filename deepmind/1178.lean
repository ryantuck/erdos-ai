Erdős Problem 1178 [BES73] [Er75b] [Er81]:

For $r, e \geq 3$, the minimal $d$ such that the $r$-uniform Turán number
$\operatorname{ex}_r(n, F) = o(n^2)$ (where $F$ is the family of all $r$-uniform hypergraphs
on $d$ vertices with $e$ edges) equals $(r-2) \cdot e + 3$.

Here `turanNumber r n d e` is the maximum number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph
on $n$ vertices avoiding all configurations on $d$ vertices with $e$ edges: formally, there
is no $d$-element set $S \subseteq \operatorname{Fin} n$ with $e$ or more $r$-uniform edges
in $S$. `minD r e` is the least such $d$.

Brown, Erdős, and Sós proved the lower bound $d_r(e) \geq (r-2) \cdot e + 3$.
Erdős, Frankl, and Rödl proved the case $e = 3$: $d_r(3) = 3(r-2)+3$ for all $r \geq 3$.
