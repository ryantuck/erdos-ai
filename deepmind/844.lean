**Erdős Problem 844** [Er92b]:

Let $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, N\}$ be such that for all $a, b \in A$, the product $ab$ is not
squarefree. Then $|A| \leq |\mathrm{extremalSet}(N)|$.

Equivalently, the maximum is achieved by the set of all even numbers together
with all odd non-squarefree numbers in $\{1, \ldots, N\}$.

Proved by Weisenberg, and independently by Alexeev, Mixon, and Sawin [AMS25].
