Erdős Problem 799 [ERT80]:

Is it true that $\chi_L(G) = o(n)$ for almost all graphs on $n$ vertices?

Formally: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and $\delta > 0$, there exists $n_0$ such that for all
$n \geq n_0$ and all $k \geq \varepsilon n$, the fraction of labeled graphs on $n$ vertices
that are $k$-choosable is at least $1 - \delta$.

The answer is yes. Alon [Al92] proved that the random graph on $n$ vertices with edge
probability $1/2$ has $\chi_L(G) \ll (\log \log n / \log n) \cdot n$ almost surely. Alon,
Krivelevich, and Sudakov [AKS99] improved this to $\chi_L(G) \asymp n / \log n$ almost surely.
