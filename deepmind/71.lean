Erdős Problem #71 (Erdős-Burr conjecture, proved by Bollobás [Bo77]):
For every infinite arithmetic progression $P = \{a, a+d, a+2d, \ldots\}$ (with $d \geq 1$)
that contains even numbers, there exists a constant $c = c(P) > 0$ such that every
finite graph with average degree at least $c$ contains a cycle whose length belongs to $P$.

The average degree of a graph $G$ on $n > 0$ vertices is $2|E(G)|/n$.
