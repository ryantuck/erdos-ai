Erdős Problem 529, Part 1:

Let $d_k(n)$ be the expected distance from the origin after taking $n$ steps of a
uniformly random self-avoiding walk in $\mathbb{Z}^k$. Is it true that
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{d_2(n)}{n^{1/2}} = \infty?$$

That is, in two dimensions, does the expected endpoint distance grow strictly
faster than $\sqrt{n}$?

Duminil-Copin and Hammond [DuHa13] proved $d_2(n) = o(n)$. It is conjectured
that $d_2(n) \sim D \cdot n^{3/4}$.

Erdős Problem 529, Part 2:

Is it true that $d_k(n) \ll n^{1/2}$ for $k \geq 3$?

Hara and Slade proved $d_k(n) \sim D \cdot n^{1/2}$ for all $k \geq 5$. It is now believed
that this is false for $k = 3$ and $k = 4$: the conjectured behavior is
$d_3(n) \sim n^{\nu}$ where $\nu \approx 0.59$ and
$d_4(n) \sim D \cdot (\log n)^{1/8} \cdot n^{1/2}$.
