# Erdős Problem 405

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/405](https://www.erdosproblems.com/405)

Let $p$ be an odd prime. Is it true that the equation
$(p-1)! + a^{p-1} = p^k$
has only finitely many solutions?

Erdős and Graham remark that it is probably true that in general
$(p-1)! + a^{p-1}$ is rarely a power at all (although this can happen,
for example $6! + 2^6 = 28^2$).

Brindza and Erdős [BrEr91] proved that there are finitely many solutions.
Yu and Liu [YuLi96] showed that the only solutions are
$2! + 1^2 = 3$, $2! + 5^2 = 3^3$, and $4! + 1^4 = 5^2$.

Erdős Problem 405 [ErGr80, p.80]:

There are only finitely many triples $(p, a, k)$ of natural numbers with $p$ an
odd prime such that $(p-1)! + a^{p-1} = p^k$.
