# Erdős Problem 586

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/586](https://www.erdosproblems.com/586)

Asked by Schinzel, motivated by a question of Erdős and Selfridge.
The answer is no, as proved by Balister, Bollobás, Morris, Sahasrabudhe,
and Tiba [BBMST22].

[BBMST22] Balister, P., Bollobás, B., Morris, R., Sahasrabudhe, J., and Tiba, M.,

mathematicae (2022).

/-- A covering system: a finite collection of residue classes $a_i \bmod n_i$ (with $n_i \geq 2$)
    that covers every integer. -/

  (∀ z : ℤ, ∃ i : Fin k, (n i : ℤ) ∣ (z - a i))

/-- **Erdős Problem 586** (Schinzel): Every covering system has two moduli where one
    divides the other. Equivalently, there is no covering system with pairwise
    non-divisible moduli. Proved by Balister, Bollobás, Morris, Sahasrabudhe,
    and Tiba [BBMST22]. -/

theorem erdos_586 :
    ∀ (k : ℕ) (a : Fin k → ℤ) (n : Fin k → ℕ),
      IsCoveringSystem k a n →
      ∃ i j : Fin k, i ≠ j ∧ (n i ∣ n j ∨ n j ∣ n i) := by
