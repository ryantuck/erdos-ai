Erdős Problem 552 [BEFRS89]:

Is it true that, for any $c > 0$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that
$R(C_4, S_n) \leq n + \sqrt{n} - c$?

Here $C_4$ is the cycle on $4$ vertices and $S_n = K_{1,n}$ is the star on $n + 1$
vertices. "Infinitely many" is formalised as: for every $N$ there exists $n \geq N$
satisfying the bound.

The known bounds are:
$$n + \sqrt{n} - 6n^{11/40} \leq R(C_4, S_n) \leq n + \lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil + 1.$$
The lower bound is due to [BEFRS89] and the upper bound is due to Parsons [Pa75].
Erdős offered \$100 for a proof or disproof.
