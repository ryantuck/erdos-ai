Erdős Problem 471 (Proved):

Given a finite set of primes $Q = Q_0$, define a sequence of sets $Q_i$ by letting
$Q_{i+1}$ be $Q_i$ together with all primes formed by adding three distinct elements
of $Q_i$. Is there some initial choice of $Q$ such that the $Q_i$ become arbitrarily large?

A problem of Ulam. Proved by Mrazović and Kovač, and independently Alon, using
Vinogradov's theorem that every large odd integer is the sum of three distinct primes.
In particular, there exists $N$ such that every prime $> N$ is the sum of three distinct
smaller primes. Taking $Q_0$ to be all primes $\leq N$, all primes eventually appear.
