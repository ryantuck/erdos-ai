Erdős Conjecture (Problem 1035) [Er93, p.345]:

Is there a constant $c > 0$ such that every graph on $2^n$ vertices with
minimum degree $> (1 - c) \cdot 2^n$ contains the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$?

Formulated as: there exists $c > 0$ such that for all $n$ and for every graph $G$
on $2^n$ vertices, if every vertex has degree $> (1 - c) \cdot 2^n$, then $G$ contains
a copy of $Q_n$ as a subgraph.
