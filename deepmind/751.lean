# Erdős Problem 751

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/751](https://www.erdosproblems.com/751)

Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\chi(G) = 4$. If $m_1 < m_2 < \cdots$ are the
lengths of the cycles in $G$, can $\min(m_{i+1} - m_i)$ be arbitrarily large?

The answer is no: Bondy and Vince [BoVi98] proved that every graph with minimum degree
at least $3$ has two cycles whose lengths differ by at most $2$, and hence the same is
true for every graph with chromatic number $4$.

two_. Journal of Graph Theory (1998), 11-15.

/-- **Bondy–Vince Theorem (Erdős Problem 751)**: Every graph with minimum degree at
least $3$ contains two cycles whose lengths differ by at most $2$. This resolves
Erdős Problem 751 in the negative: for every graph with chromatic number $4$, the gaps
between consecutive cycle lengths cannot be made arbitrarily large.
