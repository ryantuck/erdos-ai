Erdős–Gyárfás Conjecture (Problem 135) [Er97b, Er97e]:
Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points such that any $4$ points determine at least
$5$ distinct distances. Must $A$ determine $\gg n^2$ many distances?

The conjecture asserts YES: there exists an absolute constant $c > 0$ such that
every finite $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ with the four-point-five-distance property satisfies
$|\text{distinct distances of } A| \geq c \cdot n^2$.

This was answered in the NEGATIVE by Tao [Ta24c], who constructed for any
large $n$ a set of $n$ points where any $4$ points determine at least $5$ distinct
distances, yet the number of distinct distances is $O(n^2 / \sqrt{\log n})$.
