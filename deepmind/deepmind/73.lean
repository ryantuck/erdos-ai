# Erdős Problem 73

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/73](https://www.erdosproblems.com/73)

If every induced subgraph of $G$ on $n$ vertices has an independent set of size
$\geq (n - k)/2$, then removing $O_k(1)$ vertices makes $G$ bipartite.
Proved by Reed [Re99].

number).

Let $k \geq 0$. If $G$ is a finite graph such that every induced subgraph $H$ on $n$
vertices contains an independent set of size $\geq (n - k) / 2$, then there exists
a set $S$ of $O_k(1)$ vertices whose removal makes $G$ bipartite.

Equivalently: for every $k$, there exists a constant $C$ (depending only on $k$)
such that for any finite graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, if every vertex subset $S$
contains an independent set of size at least $(|S| - k) / 2$, then $G$ can be
made bipartite by removing at most $C$ vertices.

Proved by Reed [Re99].

The $k = 0$ case of Erdős Problem 73: if every vertex subset $S$ of $G$ contains
an independent set of size $\geq |S| / 2$, then $G$ is bipartite (no vertex removal needed).

This is trivial: a non-bipartite graph contains an odd cycle, which violates the
independent-set hypothesis. Noted by Reed [Re99].
