# Erdős Problem 15

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/15](https://www.erdosproblems.com/15)

Is the alternating series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \cdot n / p_n$ convergent, where $p_n$
denotes the $n$-th prime? Tao [Ta23] has proved convergence assuming a strong form of the
Hardy–Littlewood prime tuples conjecture.

Erdős also conjectured [Er98]:
- $\sum (-1)^n / (n(p_{n+1} - p_n))$ converges,
- $\sum (-1)^n / (p_{n+1} - p_n)$ diverges,
- $\sum (-1)^n / (n(p_{n+1} - p_n)(\log\log n)^c)$ converges for all $c > 0$.

Weisenberg showed that Zhang's result [Zh14] on bounded prime gaps implies the second variant
diverges, and argued the series is unbounded in at least one direction under Hardy–Littlewood.
Erdős–Nathanson and Sawhney proved absolute convergence of the third variant for $c > 2$.

Is it true that the alternating series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n}{p_n}$$
converges, where $p_n$ denotes the $n$-th prime?

This is an open problem. Tao [Ta23] has proved convergence assuming a strong form
of the Hardy–Littlewood prime tuples conjecture.

We state convergence as: the sequence of partial sums
$$S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} (-1)^n \cdot \frac{n}{p_n}$$
converges to a real limit $L$.

Using 0-indexed `Nat.nth Nat.Prime`, the $n$-th term ($n : \mathbb{N}$, 0-indexed) is
$(-1)^{n+1} \cdot (n+1) / p_{n+1}$, corresponding to the 1-indexed mathematical term.

**Variant 1** [Er98]: Does the alternating series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \cdot \frac{1}{n(p_{n+1} - p_n)}$$
converge? Erdős conjectured it does.

We use 0-indexed `primeGap n = p_{n+1} - p_n` and shift the summation index by 1.
The sum starts at $n = 1$ (0-indexed) to avoid division by zero at $n = 0$.

**Variant 3** [Er98]: Does the alternating series

Erdős–Nathanson and Sawhney proved absolute convergence for $c > 2$.
The sum starts at $n = 3$ (0-indexed $n = 2$) to ensure $\log\log n > 0$.
