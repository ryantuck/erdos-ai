# Erdős Problem 16

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/16](https://www.erdosproblems.com/16)

Erdős [Er50] showed that the set of odd integers not of the form $2^k + p$ (with $p$ prime)
contains an infinite arithmetic progression, and asked whether this set is the union of an
infinite AP and a density-zero set. Chen [Ch23] proved it is not.

non-negative integer $k$ and any prime $p$.

/--
The set of odd integers not of the form $2^k + p$ (where $p$ is prime and $k \geq 0$)
is **not** the union of an infinite arithmetic progression and a set of natural density zero.

Erdős [Er95, p.167] asked whether this set equals $AP \cup D$ for some infinite arithmetic
progression $AP$ and density-zero set $D$, calling the conjecture 'rather silly'. Using covering
congruences, Erdős [Er50] showed this set contains an infinite arithmetic progression.
Chen [Ch23] resolved the question negatively.
