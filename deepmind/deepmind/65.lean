# Erdős Problem 65

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/65](https://www.erdosproblems.com/65)

*Related:* Erdős Problem 57.

Is the sum of reciprocals of distinct cycle lengths in a graph on $n$ vertices with $kn$
edges minimised by the complete bipartite graph? Gyárfás, Komlós, and Szemerédi [GKS84]
proved $\sum 1/a_i \gg \log k$; Liu and Montgomery [LiMo20] proved the sharp bound.

Montgomery, Milojević, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov [MMPS] showed that for sufficiently large
$k$, the sum $\sum 1/a_i$ is in fact *maximised* (not minimised) when $G$ is a complete
bipartite graph, suggesting the original minimisation conjecture is false.

Erdős Problem #65 (Erdős–Hajnal) [GKS84] [LiMo20]:
Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $kn$ edges, and let $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ be the
distinct lengths of cycles in $G$. Is it true that $\sum 1/a_i \gg \log k$? Is the sum
$\sum 1/a_i$ minimised when $G$ is a complete bipartite graph?

The first question was proved by Gyárfás, Komlós, and Szemerédi [GKS84].
Liu and Montgomery [LiMo20] proved the asymptotically sharp lower bound
$\geq (1/2 - o(1)) \log k$.

Montgomery, Milojević, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov [MMPS] showed that for sufficiently large
$k$, the sum is actually maximised by the complete bipartite graph, suggesting the original
minimisation conjecture is false.

The remaining open question is formalized below: for any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices whose edge
count equals $a \cdot b$ for some partition $a + b = n$, the sum of reciprocals of distinct cycle
lengths of $G$ is at least the corresponding sum for the complete bipartite graph $K_{a,b}$.
