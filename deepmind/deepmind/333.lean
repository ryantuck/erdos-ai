Erdős Problem 333 [ErGr80] (DISPROVED):

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a set of density zero. Does there exist a set
$B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $A \subseteq B + B$ and
$|B \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| = o(N^{1/2})$?

Here $B + B = \{b_1 + b_2 \mid b_1, b_2 \in B\}$ is the sumset of $B$ with itself, and
$o(N^{1/2})$ means that $|B \cap \{1, \ldots, N\}| / N^{1/2} \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$.

Erdős and Newman [ErNe77] proved this is true when $A$ is the set of squares.
However, Theorem 2 of [ErNe77] already implies a negative answer to this
problem in general, though this was overlooked by Erdős and Graham.
