# Erdős Problem 57

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/57](https://www.erdosproblems.com/57)

If $G$ is a graph with infinite chromatic number and $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ are the lengths
of its odd cycles, then $\sum 1/a_i = \infty$. Conjectured by Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa66],
proved by Liu and Montgomery [LiMo20].

Erdős later asked ([Er81]) whether the odd cycle lengths must have positive upper density
among the odd numbers, a strictly stronger property. See also Problem 65 for a related
result on sums of reciprocals of all cycle lengths.

Erdős Problem 57 (Conjectured by Erdős-Hajnal [ErHa66], proved by Liu-Montgomery [LiMo20]):
If $G$ is a graph with infinite chromatic number and $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ are the lengths of
the odd cycles of $G$, then $\sum 1/a_i = \infty$.

We formalize "$\sum 1/a_i = \infty$" as: for any real bound $B$, there exists a finite set $T$
of odd cycle lengths of $G$ whose reciprocals sum to at least $B$.

Variant of Erdős Problem 57 (Erdős [Er81]):
If $G$ has infinite chromatic number, must the set of odd cycle lengths have positive
upper density among the odd numbers? This is strictly stronger than the reciprocal
divergence in `erdos_57`, since positive upper density implies divergence of reciprocals
but not conversely.
