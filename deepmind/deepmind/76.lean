# Erdős Problem 76

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/76](https://www.erdosproblems.com/76)

In any 2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$ there must exist at least
$(1 + o(1)) \, n^2/12$ many edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles.

Conjectured by Erdős, Faudree, and Ordman [Er95][Er97d]. Proved by Gruslys and
Letzter [GrLe20].

The bound is tight: partition $V(K_n)$ into two equal halves, colour edges
between parts red and edges within parts blue — any edge-disjoint monochromatic
triangle must either use 3 blue edges (within a part) or 3 red edges (between
parts), and a careful count shows $\approx n^2/12$ is achievable but not more.

**Erdős Problem 76** (Erdős–Faudree–Ordman conjecture, proved by Gruslys–Letzter [GrLe20]):

In any 2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, there exist at least $(1 + o(1)) \, n^2/12$
edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles.

Formally: for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$ and any
2-colouring `col` of the edges of $K_n$, there is an edge-disjoint family of
monochromatic triangles of size at least $(1 - \varepsilon) \cdot n^2 / 12$.

**Erdős Problem 76, single-color variant** [Er97d]:

In any 2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, there exist at least $c \cdot n^2$
edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles *all of the same colour* (choosing the
better colour), for some absolute constant $c > 1/24$.

This is strictly stronger than the main problem: it asks for many edge-disjoint
triangles in a single colour class rather than across both colours.
