# Erdős Problem 37

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/37](https://www.erdosproblems.com/37)

A lacunary set cannot be an essential component (a set that strictly increases the
Schnirelmann density of every set it is added to). Proved by Ruzsa [Ru87].

See also Problem 1146 (whether $\{2^m \cdot 3^n\}$ is an essential component).

A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is an *essential component* if $d_s(A + B) > d_s(B)$ for every
$B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with $0 < d_s(B) < 1$, where $d_s$ is the Schnirelmann density.

  ∀ (B : Set ℕ), 0 < schnirelmannDensity B → schnirelmannDensity B < 1 →

A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is *lacunary* if there exists $q > 1$ such that for any two
consecutive elements $a < b$ of $A$ (with no element of $A$ strictly between them),
we have $b \geq q \cdot a$.

  ∃ (q : ℝ), q > 1 ∧ ∀ (a b : ℕ), a ∈ A → b ∈ A → a < b →
    (∀ c ∈ A, ¬(a < c ∧ c < b)) → (b : ℝ) ≥ q * (a : ℝ)

Erdős Problem 37, proved by Ruzsa [Ru87].
A lacunary set cannot be an essential component.
Ruzsa proved that if $A$ is an essential component then there exists some constant
$c > 0$ such that $|A \cap \{1,\ldots,N\}| \geq (\log N)^{1+c}$ for all large $N$, which rules
out lacunary sets (which satisfy $|A \cap \{1,\ldots,N\}| = O(\log N)$).

Ruzsa's density lower bound for essential components [Ru87]:
if $A$ is an essential component, then there exists $c > 0$ such that
$|A \cap \{1,\ldots,N\}| \geq (\log N)^{1+c}$ for all sufficiently large $N$.

Optimality of the density lower bound [Ru87]:
for any $c > 0$, there exists an essential component $A$ with
$|A \cap \{1,\ldots,N\}| \leq (\log N)^{1+c}$ for all sufficiently large $N$.
