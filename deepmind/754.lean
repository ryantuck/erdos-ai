# Erdős Problem 754

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/754](https://www.erdosproblems.com/754)

Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that there exists a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^4$
in which every $x \in A$ has at least $f(n)$ points in $A$ equidistant from $x$.

Is it true that $f(n) \leq n/2 + O(1)$?

Avis, Erdős, and Pach [AEP88] proved that $n/2 + 2 \leq f(n) \leq (1 + o(1))n/2$.
This was proved by Swanepoel [Sw13].

**Erdős Problem 754** [Er94b]:

Let $f(n)$ be the largest $k$ such that there exists a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^4$
where every $x \in A$ has at least $k$ other points in $A$ all at the same distance
from $x$. Is it true that $f(n) \leq n/2 + O(1)$?

Formulated as: there exists a constant $C$ such that for every finite set
$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^4$ of $n$ points, if every point $x \in A$ has at least $k$ other
points at a common distance from $x$, then $k \leq n/2 + C$.

theorem erdos_754 :
    ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ n : ℕ, ∀ A : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 4)),
      A.card = n →
      ∀ k : ℕ,
        (∀ x ∈ A, ∃ d : ℝ,
          k ≤ (A.filter (fun y => x ≠ y ∧ dist x y = d)).card) →
        (k : ℝ) ≤ n / 2 + C := by
