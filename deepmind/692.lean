Erdős Problem 692 [Er79e, Ob1] — DISPROVED

Let $\delta_1(n, m)$ be the natural density of the set of positive integers with exactly
one divisor in the open interval $(n, m)$. Erdős asked (1986, Oberwolfach) whether,
for fixed $n$, $\delta_1(n, m)$ is unimodal as a function of $m$ for $m > n + 1$.

Cambie [Ca25] disproved this by showing it fails even for $n = 3$:
$$\delta_1(3, 6) = 0.35, \quad \delta_1(3, 7) \approx 0.33, \quad \delta_1(3, 8) \approx 0.3619,$$
exhibiting a "valley" at $m = 7$ that contradicts unimodality.
Furthermore, for fixed $n$, the sequence $\delta_1(n, m)$ has superpolynomially many
local maxima in $m$.

The theorem formalizes the disproof: there exist $n, m_1 < m_2 < m_3$ (all $> n + 1$)
such that $\delta_1(n, m_2) < \delta_1(n, m_1)$ and $\delta_1(n, m_2) < \delta_1(n, m_3)$.
