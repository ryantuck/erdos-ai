# Session Summary: Erdős Problem #1 Formalization

## Overview
This session focused on formalizing Erdős's conjecture on sum-distinct sets (Problem #1) into Lean 4, integrating Mathlib, and reviewing the formalization for mathematical accuracy.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Environment Setup
- Initialized a `lakefile.toml` to manage the Lean project.
- Configured Mathlib dependency (revision `v4.28.0`) and updated the project using `lake update`.
- Established a directory structure: `conjectures/`, `reviews/`, and `sessions/`.

### 2. Formalization of Problem #1
- **File**: `conjectures/Conjecture1.lean`
- **Definition**: Created `HasDistinctSubsetSums` to capture the "sum-distinct" property using `Finset` and `BigOperators`.
- **Theorem**: Formalized the conjecture:
  $$\exists c > 0, \forall A \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\} 	ext{ (sum-distinct)}, N \ge c \cdot 2^{|A|}$$
- **Corrections**: 
  - Updated import paths to match current Mathlib structure (`Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Group.Finset.Basic`).
  - Corrected Lean 4 syntax for sums (using `∈` and proper parenthesization).
  - Renamed the file from `1.lean` to `Conjecture1.lean` to comply with Lean module naming conventions (modules cannot start with a digit).

### 3. Review and Documentation
- **Review**: Performed a critical review of the formalization, noting its treatment of asymptotic notation and edge cases like $n=0$. Saved to `reviews/1.md`.
- **Verification**: Confirmed that `lake build` completes successfully with the new structure.

## Technical Details
- **Lean Version**: 4.28.0
- **Key Modules**: `Finset`, `BigOperators`, `Real`.
- **Project Structure**:
